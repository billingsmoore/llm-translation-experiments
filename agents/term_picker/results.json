            "reasoning": "These terms are widely accepted in academic Buddhist studies, reflecting both the Sanskrit original and its conceptual meaning. 'Bodhicitta' preserves the technical nature, while 'awakening mind' and 'mind of enlightenment' offer more interpretive translations that capture the essence of the concept."

            "term": "bodhichitta",
            "reasoning": "For practitioners, 'bodhichitta' is often left untranslated due to its widespread use. 'Enlightened attitude' and 'heart of awakening' are more evocative translations that emphasize the transformative and compassionate aspects of the concept, aligning with the practitioner's focus on cultivation and application."

        "technical_analysis": "བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་ (bodhichitta) is consistently portrayed as a fundamental concept in Mahayana Buddhist practice. It is described as something to be cultivated, never abandoned, and firmly grasped. The texts emphasize its transformative power, its ability to exhaust past negative actions, and its role in accumulating merit. It is also presented as a subject of meditation and a key factor in progressing on the bodhisattva path.",
        "cultural_context": "In these contexts, བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་ is central to Mahayana Buddhist soteriology. It is seen as superior to the practices of hearers (ཉན་ཐོས་), indicating its importance in the Mahayana path. The term is often used in aspirational contexts, such as vows and prayers for the benefit of all beings, reflecting the altruistic nature of Mahayana Buddhism."
