The Way of the Bodhisattva🔽 The Excellence of Bodhichitta🔽 Homage to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.🔽
To those who go in bliss, the dharmakāya they possess, and all their heirs,🔽 To all those worthy of respect, I reverently bow.🔽
1️⃣ According to the scriptures, I shall now in brief describe🔽 The practice of the Bodhisattva discipline.🔽
Here I shall say nothing that has not been said before,🔽 And in the art of prosody I have no skill.🔽
1️⃣ I therefore have no thought that this might be of benefit to others;🔽 I wrote it only to habituate my mind.🔽
1️⃣ My faith will thus be strengthened for a little while,🔽 That I might grow accustomed to this virtuous way.🔽
1️⃣ But others who now chance upon my words🔽 May profit also, equal to myself in fortune.🔽
1️⃣ So hard to find the ease and wealth🔽 Whereby the aims of beings may be gained.🔽
If now I fail to turn it to my profit,🔽 How could such a chance be mine again?🔽
Just as on a dark night black with clouds,🔽 The sudden lightning glares and all is clearly shown,🔽 Likewise rarely, through the Buddhas’ power,🔽 Virtuous thoughts rise, brief and transient, in the world.🔽
Virtue, thus, is weak; and always🔽 Evil is of great and overwhelming strength.🔽
1️⃣ Except for perfect bodhichitta,🔽 What other virtue is there that can lay it low?🔽
1️⃣ For many aeons deeply pondering,🔽 The mighty Sages saw its benefits,🔽 Whereby unnumbered multitudes🔽 Are brought with ease to supreme joy.🔽
Those who wish to crush the many sorrows of existence,🔽 Who wish to quell the pain of living beings,🔽 Who wish to have experience of a myriad joys🔽 Should never turn away from bodhichitta.🔽
Should bodhichitta come to birth🔽 In those who suffer, chained in prisons of saṃsāra,🔽 In that instant they are called the children of the Blissful One,🔽 Revered by all the world, by gods and humankind.🔽
1️⃣ For like the supreme substance of the alchemists,🔽 It takes our impure flesh and makes of it🔽 The body of a Buddha, jewel beyond all price.🔽
1️⃣ Such is bodhichitta. Let us grasp it firmly!🔽
1️⃣ Since the boundless wisdom of the only guide of beings🔽 Perfectly examined and perceived its priceless worth,🔽 Those who wish to leave this state of wandering🔽, Should hold well to this precious bodhichitta.🔽
All other virtues, like the plantain tree,🔽 Produce their fruit, but then their force is spent.🔽
Alone the marvelous tree of bodhichitta🔽, Constantly bears fruit and grows unceasingly.🔽
1️⃣ As though they pass through perils guarded by a hero,🔽 Even those weighed down with dreadful wickedness🔽 Will instantly be freed through having bodhichitta.🔽
1️⃣ Why do those who fear their sins not have recourse to it?🔽
1️⃣ Just as by the fire that will destroy the world,🔽 Great sins are surely and at once consumed by it.🔽
1️⃣ Its benefits are thus unbounded🔽 As the Wise and Loving Lord explained to Sudhana.🔽
1️⃣ Bodhichitta, the awakened mind,🔽 Is known in brief to have two aspects:🔽 First, aspiring, bodhichitta in intention;🔽 Then active bodhichitta, practical engagement.🔽
As corresponding to the wish to go🔽 And then to setting out,🔽 The wise should understand respectively🔽 The difference that divides these two.🔽
From bodhichitta in intention🔽 Great results arise for those still turning in the wheel of life;🔽 Yet merit does not rise from it in ceaseless streams🔽 As is the case with active bodhichitta.🔽
1️⃣ For when, with irreversible intent,🔽 The mind embraces bodhichitta,🔽 Willing to set free the endless multitudes of beings,🔽 In that instant, from that moment on,🔽 A great and unremitting stream,🔽 A strength of wholesome merit,🔽 Even during sleep and inattention,🔽 Rises equal to the vastness of the sky.🔽
1️⃣ This the Tathāgata,🔽 In the sūtra Subāhu requested,🔽 Said with reasoned argument🔽 For those inclined to lesser paths.🔽
1️⃣ If with kindly generosity🔽 One merely has the wish to soothe🔽 The aching heads of other beings,🔽 Such merit knows no bounds.🔽
1️⃣ No need to speak, then, of the wish🔽 To drive away the endless pain🔽 Of each and every living being,🔽 Bringing them unbounded excellence.🔽
Could our father or our mother🔽 Ever have so generous a wish?🔽
Do the very gods, the ṛiṣhis, even Brahmā🔽 Harbor such benevolence as this?🔽
For in the past they never,🔽 Even in their dreams,🔽 Wished something like this even for themselves.🔽
1️⃣ How could they do so for another’s sake?🔽
This aim to bring the benefit of beings,🔽 A benefit that others wish not even for themselves,🔽 This noble, jewellike state of mind🔽 Arises truly wondrous, never seen before.🔽
This pain-dispelling draft,🔽 This cause of joy for those who wander through the world,🔽 This precious attitude, this jewel of mind🔽 How shall we calculate its merit?🔽
1️⃣ If the simple thought to be of help to others🔽 Exceeds in worth the worship of the Buddhas,🔽 What need is there to speak of actual deeds🔽 That bring about the weal and benefit of beings?🔽
For beings long to free themselves from misery,🔽 But misery itself they follow and pursue.🔽
1️⃣ They long for joy, but in their ignorance🔽 Destroy it, as they would their foe.🔽
But those who fill with bliss🔽, All beings destitute of joy,🔽 Who cut all pain and suffering away🔽, From those weighed down with misery,🔽 Who drive away the darkness of their ignorance—🔽 
What virtue could be matched with theirs?🔽 What friend could be compared to them?🔽
What merit is there similar to this?🔽
If someone who returns a favor🔽 Is deserving of some praise,🔽 Why need we speak of Bodhisattvas,🔽 Those who do good even unsolicited?🔽
People praise as virtuous donors🔽 Those who with contempt support🔽 A few with plain and ordinary food:🔽 A moment’s gift that feeds for only half a day.🔽
What need is there to speak of those🔽 Who long bestow on countless multitudes🔽 The peerless joy of blissful Buddhahood🔽 The ultimate fulfillment of their hopes?🔽
1️⃣ All those who harbor evil in their minds🔽 Against such lords of generosity, the Buddha’s heirs,🔽 Will stay in hell, the mighty Sage has said,🔽 For ages equal to the moments of their malice.🔽
But joyous and devoted thoughts🔽 Will yield abundant fruits in greater strength.🔽
1️⃣ Even in great trouble, Bodhisattvas🔽 Never bring forth wrong; their virtues naturally increase.🔽
1️⃣ To them in whom this precious jewel of mind🔽 Is born—to them I bow!🔽
1️⃣ I go for refuge to those springs of happiness🔽 Who bring their very enemies to perfect bliss.🔽
2 Confession🔽 To the Buddhas, those thus gone,🔽 And to the sacred Dharma, spotless and supremely rare,🔽 And to the Buddha’s offspring, oceans of good qualities,🔽 That I might gain this precious attitude, I make a perfect offering.🔽
I offer every fruit and flower,🔽 Every kind of healing draft🔽 And all the precious gems the world contains,🔽 With all pure waters of refreshment;🔽 Every mountain wrought of precious jewels,🔽 All sweet and lonely forest groves,🔽 The trees of paradise adorned with blossom,🔽 Trees with branches bowed with perfect fruit;🔽 The perfumed fragrance of divine and other realms,🔽 All incense, wishing trees, and trees of gems,🔽 All crops that grow without the tiller’s care,🔽 And every sumptuous object worthy to be offered;🔽 Lakes and meres adorned with lotuses,🔽 Delightful with the sweet-voiced cries of waterbirds,🔽 
And everything unclaimed and free🔽 Extending to the margins of the boundless sky.🔽1️⃣ I hold them all before my mind, and to the mighty Sage, the greatest of our kind,🔽 And to his heirs, I make a perfect offering.🔽
1️⃣ Sublime recipients, compassionate lords,🔽 O think of me with love; accept these gifts of mine!🔽
For, destitute of merit, I am very poor;🔽 I have no other wealth.
1️⃣ And so, protectors,🔽 You whose wise intentions are for others’ good,🔽 In your great power, receive them for my sake.🔽
Enlightened ones and all your Bodhisattva heirs,🔽 I offer you my body throughout all my lives.🔽
1️⃣ Supreme courageous ones accept me totally.🔽
1️⃣ For with devotion I will be your slave.🔽
For if you will accept me, I will be🔽 Undaunted by saṃsāra and will act for beings’ sake.🔽
1️⃣ I’ll leave behind the evils of my past,🔽 And ever after turn my face from them.🔽
A bathing chamber excellently fragrant,🔽 With even floors of crystal, radiant and clear,🔽 And graceful pillars shimmering with gems,🔽 All hung about with gleaming canopies of pearls—🔽 There the blissful Buddhas and their heirs🔽 I’ll bathe with many a precious vase,🔽 Abrim with water fragrant and delightful,🔽 With cloths of unexampled quality,🔽 With spotless, perfumed towels I will dry them,🔽 
And offer splendid scented clothes,🔽 Well-dyed and of surpassing excellence.🔽 With different garments, light and supple,🔽 And a hundred beautiful adornments,🔽 I will grace sublime Samantabhadra,🔽 Mañjughoṣha, Lokeshvara, and their kin.🔽
And with a sumptuous fragrance which🔽 Pervades a thousand million worlds,🔽 I will anoint the bodies of the mighty Sages,🔽 Gleaming bright like burnished gold refined and cleansed.🔽
I place before the mighty Sages, perfect objects of my worship,🔽 Glorious flowers like lotus and mandāravā,🔽 The utpala, and other fragrant blossoms,🔽 Worked and twined in lovely scented garlands.🔽
I will offer swelling clouds of frankincense,🔽 Whose ambient perfume ravishes the mind,🔽 And various foods and every kind of drink,🔽 All delicacies worthy of the gods.🔽
I will offer precious lamps🔽 Arranged in rows on lotuses of gold,🔽 A carpet of sweet flowers scattering🔽 Upon the level, incense-sprinkled ground.🔽
To those whose very nature is compassion🔽 I will give vast palaces, resounding with fair praise,🔽 All decked with precious pearls and beauteous pendant gems,🔽 Gleaming jewels that deck the amplitude of space.🔽
Fair and precious parasols adorned with golden shafts,🔽 All bordered round with hems of precious jewels,🔽 Upright, well-proportioned, pleasing to the eye,🔽 Again, all this I give to all the Buddhas.🔽
May a host of other offerings,🔽 And clouds of ravishing sweet melody🔽 That solaces the pain of living beings🔽 Arise and constantly abide.🔽
May rains of flowers and every precious gem🔽 Fall down in an unceasing stream🔽 Upon the Jewels of Sacred Dharma,🔽 Images and all supports for offering.🔽
1️⃣ Just as Mañjughoṣha and the like🔽 Made offering to all the Conquerors,🔽 I do likewise to all the Buddhas our protectors,🔽 And to all their Bodhisattva children.🔽
To these vast oceans of good qualities🔽 I offer praise, a sea of airs and harmonies.🔽
May clouds of tuneful eulogy🔽 Ascend unceasingly before them.🔽
To Buddhas of the past, the present, and all future time,🔽 And to the Dharma and Sublime Assembly,🔽 With bodies many as the grains of dust🔽 Upon the earth, I will prostrate and bow.🔽
To shrines and all supports🔽 Of bodhichitta I bow down;🔽 To abbots who transmit the vows, to every learned master,🔽 And to all sublime practitioners of Dharma.🔽
Until the essence of enlightenment is reached,🔽 I go for refuge to the Buddhas.🔽
1️⃣ Also I take refuge in the Dharma🔽 And in all the host of Bodhisattvas.🔽
To perfect Buddhas and to Bodhisattvas,🔽 In all directions where they may reside,🔽 To them who are the sovereigns of great mercy,🔽 I press my palms together, praying thus:🔽 “In this and all my other lives,🔽 While turning in the round without beginning,🔽 Blindly I have brought forth evil,🔽 And incited others to commit the same.🔽 
Deceived and overmastered by my ignorance,🔽 I have taken pleasure in such sin,🔽 And seeing now the blame of it,🔽 O great protectors, I confess it earnestly!🔽 
Whatever I have done against the Triple Gem,🔽 Against my parents, teachers, and the rest,🔽 Through force of my defilements,🔽 In my body, speech, and mind,🔽 “All the evil I, a sinner, have committed,🔽 All the wicked deeds that cling to me,🔽 The frightful things that I contrived🔽 I openly declare to you, the teachers of the world.🔽 
1️⃣ It may be that my death will come to me🔽 Before my evil has been cleansed.🔽
1️⃣ How then can I be freed from it?🔽
1️⃣ I pray you, quickly grant me your protection!”🔽
We cannot trust the wanton Lord of Death.🔽
1️⃣ The task complete or still to do, he will not wait.🔽
1️⃣ In health or sickness, therefore, none of us can trust🔽 Our fleeting, momentary lives.🔽
And we must pass away, forsaking all.🔽
But I, devoid of understanding,🔽 Have, for sake of friend and foe alike,🔽 Provoked and brought about so many wrongs.🔽
But all my foes will cease to be,🔽 And all my friends will cease to be,🔽 And I will also cease to be,🔽 And likewise everything will cease to be.🔽
All that I possess and use🔽 Is like the fleeting vision of a dream.🔽
1️⃣ It fades into the realms of memory,🔽 And fading, will be seen no more.🔽
And even in the brief course of this present life,🔽 So many friends and foes have passed away,🔽 Because of whom, the evils I have done🔽 Still lie, unbearable, before me.🔽
2️⃣ The thought came never to my mind🔽 That I too am a brief and passing thing.🔽
1️⃣ And so, through hatred, lust, and ignorance,🔽 I have committed many sins.🔽
Never halting night or day,🔽 My life drains constantly away,🔽 And from no other source does increase come.🔽
How can there not be death for such as me?🔽
There I’ll be, prostrate upon my bed,🔽 And all around, my family and friends.🔽
1️⃣ But I alone shall be the one to feel🔽 The cutting of the thread of life.🔽
And when the heralds of the Deadly King have gripped me,🔽 What help to me will be my friends and kin?🔽
2️⃣ For then life’s virtue is my one defense,🔽 And this, alas, is what I shrugged away.🔽
2️⃣ O protectors!
1️⃣ I, so little heeding,🔽 Hardly guessed at horror such as this—🔽 And all for this brief, transient existence,🔽 I have done so many evil things.🔽
The day they take him to the scaffold,🔽 Where they will tear off his limbs,🔽 A man is changed, transfigured by his fear:🔽 His mouth is dry, his eyes start from his brow.🔽
1️⃣ No need to say how stricken I shall be🔽 When overcome and sick with dreadful fear,🔽 I’m seized by forms so horrible to see,🔽 The frightful servants of the Lord of Death.🔽
Who can give me safe protection🔽 From this horror, from this frightful dread?🔽
1️⃣ And then I’ll search the four directions,🔽 Seeking help, with panic-stricken eyes.🔽
But in those four directions no protection shall I find.🔽
1️⃣ And I shall sink into despairing woe.🔽
No refuge will there be for me;🔽 At such a time, what shall I do?🔽
Thus, from this day forward I take refuge🔽 In the Buddhas, guardians of beings,🔽 Who labor to protect all wanderers,🔽 Those mighty ones who scatter every fear.🔽
And in the Dharma they have realized in their hearts,🔽 Which drives away the terrors of saṃsāra,🔽 And in all the host of Bodhisattvas🔽 Likewise I will perfectly take refuge.🔽
Gripped by dread, beside myself with anguish,🔽 To Samantabhadra I will give myself;🔽 My body I myself will give🔽 To Mañjughoṣha, gentle and melodious.🔽
To him whose deeds of mercy never fail,🔽 My lord Avalokita,🔽 I cry out from depths of misery,🔽 “Protect me now an evildoer!”🔽
2️⃣ Now to the noble one, Ākāshagarbha,🔽 And to Kṣhitigarbha, from my heart I call.🔽
To all protectors, great, compassionate,🔽 I cry to them in search of refuge.🔽
To Vajrapaṇi I shall fly,🔽 For at the sight of him🔽 All vengeful things like Yama’s host🔽 Escape in terror to the four directions.🔽
Formerly your words I have transgressed,🔽 But having seen these terrors all around,🔽 I come to you for refuge praying:🔽 Swiftly drive away my fear!🔽
For if, alarmed by common ailments,🔽 I must implement the doctor’s words,🔽 What need to speak of when I’m constantly brought low🔽 By ills like lust and faults a hundredfold?🔽
And if, by one of these alone,🔽 The dwellers in the world are all thrown down,🔽 And if no other remedy exists,🔽 No other healing elsewhere to be found🔽 Than words of the all-knowing doctor,🔽 Which uproot our every ill,🔽 The thought to turn on him deaf ears🔽 Is abject and contemptible stupidity.🔽
Along a small and ordinary cliff🔽 If I must pick my way with special care,🔽 What need to speak of that long-lasting chasm🔽 Plunging to the depths a thousand leagues?🔽 
“Today, at least, I shall not die.”🔽
2️⃣ So rash to lull myself with words like these!🔽
2️⃣ My dissolution and my hour of death🔽 Will come to me, of this there is no doubt.🔽
Who can give me fearlessness,🔽 What sure escape is there from this?🔽
1️⃣ It’s certain that I’m going to die,🔽 So how can I relax, my mind at ease?🔽
2️⃣ Of life’s experience, all seasons past,🔽 What’s left to me, what now remains?🔽
1️⃣ By clinging to what now is here no more,🔽 My teacher’s precepts I have disobeyed.🔽
And when this life is left behind,🔽 And with it all my kith and kin,🔽 I must set out on strange paths all alone:🔽 Why make so much of all my friends and foes?🔽
How instead can I make sure🔽 To rid myself of evil, only cause of sorrow?🔽
1️⃣ This should be my one concern,🔽 My only thought both night and day.🔽
The wrongs that I have done🔽 Through ignorant stupidity:🔽 All actions evil by their nature🔽 And transgressions of the precepts,🔽 Fearing all the pains to come🔽 I join my palms and ceaselessly prostrate,🔽 And everything I will confess🔽 Directly in the sight of my protectors.🔽
I pray you, guides and guardians of the world,🔽 To take me as I am, a sinful man.🔽
2️⃣ And all these actions, evil as they are,🔽 I promise I will never do again.🔽
🔽
1️⃣ 3 Taking Hold of Bodhichitta🔽 With joy I celebrate the virtue that relieves all beings🔽 From the sorrows of the states of loss,🔽 Exulting in the happy states enjoyed🔽 By those who yet are suffering.🔽
1️⃣ I revel in the stores of virtue,🔽 Cause of gaining the enlightened state,🔽 And celebrate the freedom won🔽 By living beings from the round of pain.🔽
And in the Buddhahood of the protectors I delight🔽 And in the grounds of realization of the Buddhas’ heirs.🔽
Their enlightened attitude, an ocean of great good,🔽 That seeks to place all beings in the state of bliss,🔽 And every action for the benefit of beings:🔽 Such is my delight and joy.🔽
And so I join my hands and pray🔽 The Buddhas who reside in every quarter:🔽 Kindle now the Dharma’s light🔽 For those who grope, bewildered, in the dark of pain!🔽
I join my hands beseeching the enlightened ones🔽 Who wish to pass into nirvāṇa:🔽 Do not leave us wandering in blindness,🔽 Stay among us for unnumbered ages!🔽
Through these actions now performed🔽 And all the virtues I have gained,🔽 May all the pain of every living being🔽 Be wholly scattered and destroyed!🔽
1️⃣ For all those ailing in the world,🔽 Until their every sickness has been healed,🔽 May I myself become for them🔽 The doctor, nurse, the medicine itself.🔽
Raining down a flood of food and drink,🔽 May I dispel the ills of thirst and famine.🔽
1️⃣ And in the aeons marked by scarcity and want,🔽 May I myself appear as drink and sustenance.🔽
For sentient beings, poor and destitute,🔽 May I become a treasure ever-plentiful,🔽 And lie before them closely in their reach,🔽 A varied source of all that they might need.🔽
1️⃣ My body, thus, and all my goods besides,🔽 And all my merits gained and to be gained,🔽 I give them all and do not count the cost,🔽 To bring about the benefit of beings.🔽
Nirvāṇa is attained by giving all,🔽 Nirvāṇa is the object of my striving;🔽 And all must be surrendered in a single instant,🔽 Therefore it is best to give it all to others.🔽
This body I have now resigned🔽 To serve the pleasure of all living beings.🔽
1️⃣ Let them ever kill, despise, and beat it,🔽 Using it according to their wish.🔽
And though they treat it like a toy,🔽 Or make of it the butt of every mockery,🔽 My body has been given up to them.🔽
1️⃣ Why should I make so much of it?🔽
And so let beings do to me🔽 Whatever does not bring them injury.🔽
1️⃣ Whenever they may think of me,🔽 Let this not fail to bring them benefit.🔽
And if in my regard they have🔽 A thought of anger or respect,🔽 May these states always be the cause🔽 Whereby their good and wishes are fulfilled.🔽
All those who slight me to my face🔽 Or do to me some other evil,🔽 Even if they blame or slander me,🔽 May they attain the fortune of enlightenment!🔽
May I be a guard for those who are protectorless,🔽 A guide for those who journey on the road.🔽
1️⃣ For those who wish to cross the water,🔽 May I be a boat, a raft, a bridge.🔽
May I be an isle for those who yearn for land,🔽 A lamp for those who long for light;🔽 For all who need a resting place, a bed;🔽 For those who need a servant, may I be their slave.🔽
May I be the wishing jewel, the vase of wealth,🔽 A word of power and the supreme healing,🔽 May I be the tree of miracles,🔽 For every being the abundant cow.🔽
Just like the earth and space itself🔽 And all the other mighty elements,🔽 For boundless multitudes of beings🔽 May I always be the ground of life, the source of varied sustenance.🔽
Thus for everything that lives,🔽 As far as are the limits of the sky,🔽 May I be constantly their source of livelihood🔽 Until they pass beyond all sorrow.🔽
Just as all the Buddhas of the past🔽 Have brought forth the awakened mind,🔽 And in the precepts of the Bodhisattvas🔽 Step-by-step abode and trained,🔽 Likewise, for the benefit of beings,🔽 I will bring to birth the awakened mind,🔽 And in those precepts, step-by-step,🔽 I will abide and train myself.🔽
Those who thus with clear intelligence🔽 Take hold of the awakened mind with bright and lucid joy,🔽 That they may now increase what they have gained,🔽 Should lift their hearts with praises such as these:🔽 “Today my life has given fruit.🔽
1️⃣ This human state has now been well assumed.🔽
Today I take my birth in Buddha’s line,🔽 And have become the Buddha’s child and heir.🔽 
1️⃣ In every way, then, I will undertake🔽 Activities befitting such a rank.🔽
1️⃣ And I will do no act to mar🔽 Or compromise this high and faultless lineage.🔽 
For I am like a blind man who has found🔽 A precious gem inside a heap of dust.🔽
1️⃣ For so it is, by some strange chance,🔽 That bodhichitta has been born in me.🔽 
1️⃣ This is the supreme draft of immortality🔽 That slays the Lord of Death, the slaughterer of beings,🔽 The rich unfailing treasure-mine🔽 To heal the poverty of wanderers.🔽 
1️⃣ It is the sovereign remedy🔽 That perfectly allays all maladies.🔽
1️⃣ It is the tree that gives relief🔽 To those who wander wearily the pathways of existence.🔽 
It is the universal bridge that saves🔽 All wandering beings from the states of loss,🔽 The rising moon of the enlightened mind🔽 That soothes the sorrows born of the afflictions.🔽 
It is the mighty sun that utterly dispels🔽 The misty ignorance of wandering beings,🔽 The creamy butter, rich and full,🔽 That’s churned from milk of holy teaching.🔽 
2️⃣ Living beings! Wayfarers upon life’s paths,🔽 Who wish to taste the riches of contentment,🔽 Here before you is the supreme bliss.🔽
3️⃣ Here, O ceaseless travelers, is your fulfillment!🔽 
2️⃣ And so, today, within the sight of all protectors,🔽 I summon beings, calling them to Buddhahood.🔽
1️⃣ And, till that state is reached, to every earthly joy!🔽
1️⃣ May gods and demigods and all the rest rejoice!”🔽
🔽
1️⃣ 4 Carefulness The children of the Conqueror who thus🔽 Have firmly grasped this bodhichitta,🔽 Should never turn aside from it,🔽 Strive never to transgress its disciplines.🔽
Whatever was begun without due heed,🔽 And all that was not properly conceived,🔽 Although a promise and a pledge were given,🔽 It is right to reconsider: Shall I act or not?🔽
Yet what the Buddhas and their heirs🔽 Have scrutinized in their great wisdom,🔽 I myself have probed and scrutinized.🔽
1️⃣ Why should I now procrastinate?🔽
For if I bind myself with promises🔽 But fail to carry out my words in deed,🔽 Then every being will have been betrayed.🔽
1️⃣ What destiny must lie in store for me?🔽
If in the teachings it is said🔽 That those who in their thoughts intend🔽 To give a small and paltry thing but then draw back🔽 Will take rebirth as hungry spirits,🔽 How can I expect a happy destiny🔽 If from my heart I summon🔽 Wandering beings to the highest bliss,🔽 But then deceive and fail them?🔽
As for those who, losing bodhichitta,🔽 Lead others nonetheless to liberation,🔽 Karmic law is inconceivable🔽 And only understood by the Omniscient.🔽
1️⃣ This failure, for the Bodhisattva,🔽 Is the gravest of all downfalls.🔽
1️⃣ For should it ever come to pass,🔽 The good of every being is thrown down.🔽
And anyone who, for a single instant,🔽 Halts the merit of a Bodhisattva🔽 Wanders endlessly in evil states,🔽 Because the welfare of all beings is reduced.🔽
Destroy a single being’s joy🔽 And you will work the ruin of yourself.🔽
1️⃣ No need to speak of bringing low🔽 The joy of beings infinite as space itself!🔽
And those who circle in saṃsāra,🔽 Mixing powerful downfalls🔽 With the power of bodhichitta back and forth,🔽 Will long be hindered from the Bodhisattva grounds.🔽
And so, according to my promise,🔽 I will act attentively.🔽
From this day forth, if I now fail to strive,🔽 I’ll fall from low to even lower states.🔽
Striving for the benefit of all that lives,🔽 Unnumbered Buddhas have already lived and passed away.🔽
But I, by virtue of my sins, have failed🔽 To come within the compass of their healing works.🔽
And this will always be my lot🔽 If I continue to behave like this,🔽 And I will suffer pains and bondage,🔽 Wounds and laceration in the lower realms.🔽
The appearance of the Buddhas in the world,🔽 True faith and the attainment of a human form,🔽 An aptitude for good: all these are rare.🔽
2️⃣ When will they come to me again?🔽
Today, indeed, I’m hale and well,🔽 I have enough to eat and I am not in danger.🔽
1️⃣ But this life is fleeting, unreliable,🔽 My body is like something briefly lent.🔽
And yet the way I act is such🔽 That I shall not regain a human life!🔽
1️⃣ And losing this, my precious human form,🔽 My evils will be many, virtues none.🔽
Here is now my chance for wholesome deeds,🔽 But if I fail to practice virtue,🔽 What will be my lot, what shall I do,🔽 Bewildered by the sorrows of the lower realms?🔽
Never, there, performing any virtue,🔽 Only ever piling up my sins,🔽 And for a hundred million ages,🔽 I’ll not even hear of happy destinies.🔽
This is why Lord Buddha has declared🔽 That like a turtle that perchance can place🔽 Its head within a yoke adrift upon the mighty sea🔽 This human birth is difficult to find!🔽
1️⃣ If through the evil action of a single instant🔽 I must spend an aeon in the hell of Unrelenting Pain,🔽 The evils in saṃsāra stored from time without beginning—🔽 No need to say that they will keep me from the states of bliss!🔽
And mere experience of such pain🔽 Does not result in being freed from it.🔽
2️⃣ For in the very suffering of such states,🔽 More evil will occur, and then in great abundance.🔽
1️⃣ Thus, having found this moment of reprieve,🔽 If I now fail to train myself in virtue,🔽 What greater folly could there ever be?🔽
2️⃣ How more could I betray myself?🔽
1️⃣ If having understood all this,🔽 I’m stupidly despondent still,🔽 Then at the moment of my death,🔽 My sorrows will be black indeed.🔽
And when my body burns so long🔽 In fires of hell so unendurable,🔽 My mind, there is no doubt, will also be tormented,🔽 Burned in fires of unendurable regret.🔽
1️⃣ For it’s as if by chance that I have gained🔽 This state so hard to find, wherein to help myself.🔽
If now, while having such discernment,🔽 I am once again consigned to hell,🔽 I am as if benumbed by sorcery,🔽 As if reduced to total mindlessness.🔽
1️⃣ I do not know what dulls my wits.🔽
1️⃣ O what is it that has me in its grip?🔽
1️⃣ Anger, lust, these enemies of mine,🔽 Are limbless and devoid of faculties.🔽
1️⃣ They have no bravery, no cleverness;🔽 How then have they reduced me to such slavery?🔽
1️⃣ They dwell within my mind🔽 And at their pleasure injure me.🔽
1️⃣ All this I suffer meekly, unresenting—🔽 Thus my abject patience, all displaced!🔽
If all the gods and demigods besides🔽 Together came against me as my foes,🔽 They would be powerless to throw me down🔽 To fires of hell of Unrelenting Pain.🔽
1️⃣ And yet the mighty fiend of my afflictions🔽 Flings me in an instant headlong down🔽 To where the mighty lord of mountains🔽 Would be burned, its very ashes all consumed.🔽
1️⃣ O my enemy, afflictive passion,🔽 Endless and beginningless companion!🔽
1️⃣ No other enemy indeed🔽 Is able to endure so long!🔽
1️⃣ All other foes that I appease and wait upon🔽 Will show me favors, give me every aid,🔽 But should I serve my dark defiled emotions,🔽 They will only harm me, draw me down to grief.🔽
1️⃣ If thus my ancient and unceasing foes,🔽 The wellspring only of my growing pain,🔽 Can lodge so safe within my heart,🔽 How can I live so blithe and fearless in this wheel of life?🔽
1️⃣ And if the jail guards of the prisons of saṃsāra,🔽 The butchers and tormentors of infernal realms,🔽 All lurk within me in the web of craving,🔽 What joy can ever be my destiny?🔽
1️⃣ I will not leave the fight until, before my eyes,🔽 These enemies of mine are all destroyed.🔽
1️⃣ For if, aroused to fury by the merest slight,🔽 Incapable of sleep until the scores are settled,🔽 Proud but wretched rivals, destined all to suffer when they die,🔽 Will draw the battle lines and do their best to win,🔽 And careless of the pain of cut and thrust,🔽 Will stand their ground refusing to give way,🔽 No need to say that I will not lose heart,🔽 Regardless of the hardships of the fray.🔽
1️⃣ From this day forth I’ll strive to crush🔽 These foes whose very nature is to bring me pain.🔽
1️⃣ The wounds inflicted by the enemy in futile wars🔽 Are flaunted by the soldier as a prize.🔽
1️⃣ So in the high endeavor, for so great a thing,🔽 Why should I be dismayed by hurt or injury?🔽
When fishers, butchers, farmers, and the like,🔽 Intending just to gain their livelihood,🔽 Will suffer all the miseries of heat and cold,🔽 Why, for beings’ happiness, should those like me not bear the same?🔽
1️⃣ When I pledged myself to free from their afflictions🔽 Beings who abide in every region,🔽 Stretching to the limits of the sky,🔽 I was myself not free from such defilements.🔽
1️⃣ To speak like that, not knowing my capacity,🔽 Were these not, truly, but a madman’s words?🔽
1️⃣ More reason then for never drawing back🔽 Abandoning the fight against defiled affliction.🔽
2️⃣ This shall be my all-consuming passion.🔽
1️⃣ Filled with rancor I will wage my war!🔽
1️⃣ Defilement of this kind will halt defilement🔽 And for this reason it shall not be spurned.🔽
1️⃣ Better if I perish in the fire,🔽 Better that my head be severed from my body🔽 Than ever I should serve or reverence🔽 My mortal enemies, defiled emotions.🔽
Common foes, when driven from the state,🔽 Retreat and base themselves in other lands,🔽 And muster all their strength the better to return.🔽
1️⃣ But enemy afflictions are without such stratagems.🔽
Miserable defilements, scattered by the eye of wisdom!🔽
1️⃣ Where will you now run, when driven from my mind?🔽
1️⃣ Whence would you return to do me harm?🔽
1️⃣ But oh, my mind is feeble. I am indolent!🔽
Defilements are not in the object,🔽 Nor within the faculties, nor somewhere in between.🔽
1️⃣ And if not elsewhere, where is their abode,🔽 Whence they inflict their havoc on the world?🔽
1️⃣ They are simple mirages, and so take heart!🔽 Banish all your fear and strive to know their nature.🔽
1️⃣ Why suffer needlessly the pains of hell?🔽
This is how I should reflect and labor,🔽 That I might apply the precepts thus set forth.🔽
What invalids in need of medicine🔽 Ignored their doctor’s words and gained their health?🔽

1️⃣ 5 Vigilant Introspection🔽 
Those who wish to keep the trainings🔽 Must with perfect self-possession guard their minds.🔽
Without this guard upon the mind,🔽 The trainings cannot be preserved.🔽
2️⃣ Wandering where it will, the elephant of mind,🔽 Will bring us down to torment in the hell of Unrelenting Pain.🔽
1️⃣ No worldly beast, however wild and crazed,🔽 Could bring upon us such calamities.🔽
If, with mindfulness’ rope,🔽 The elephant of mind is tethered all around,🔽 Our fears will come to nothing,🔽 Every virtue drop into our hands.🔽
Tigers, lions, elephants, and bears,🔽 Snakes and every hostile foe,🔽 Those who guard the prisoners in hell,🔽 Ghosts and ghouls and every evil wraith,🔽 By simple binding of this mind alone,🔽 All these things are likewise bound.🔽
1️⃣ By simple taming of this mind alone,🔽 All these things are likewise tamed.🔽
For all anxiety and fear,🔽 And pain in boundless quantity,🔽 Their source and wellspring is the mind itself,🔽 As He who spoke the truth declared.🔽
The hellish instruments to torture living beings—🔽 Who invented them for such intent?🔽
Who has forged this burning iron ground;🔽 Whence have all these demon-women sprung?🔽
All are but the offspring of the sinful mind,🔽 This the mighty Sage has said.🔽
Throughout the triple world therefore🔽 There is no greater bane than mind itself.🔽
If transcendent giving is🔽 To dissipate the poverty of beings,🔽 In what way—since the poor are always with us—🔽 Have former Buddhas practiced it?🔽
Transcendent giving, so the teachings say,🔽 Consists in the intention to bestow on every being🔽 All one owns, together with the fruits of such a gift.🔽
1️⃣ It is indeed a matter of the mind itself.🔽
Where could beings, fishes, and the rest,🔽 Be placed to keep them safe from being killed?🔽
2️⃣ Deciding to refrain from every harmful act🔽 Is said to be transcendent discipline.🔽
Harmful beings are everywhere like space itself.🔽
1️⃣ Impossible it is that all should be suppressed.🔽
But let this angry mind alone be overthrown,🔽 And it’s as though all foes had been subdued.🔽
To cover all the earth with sheets of leather—🔽 Where could such amounts of skin be found?🔽
But with the leather soles of just my shoes🔽 It is as though I cover all the earth!🔽
And thus the outer course of things🔽 I myself cannot restrain.🔽
1️⃣ But let me just restrain my mind,🔽 And what is left to be restrained?🔽
A clear intent can fructify🔽 And bring us birth in such as Brahmā’s realm.🔽
The acts of body and of speech are less—🔽 They do not generate a like result.🔽
Recitations and austerities,🔽 Long though they may prove to be,🔽 If practiced with distracted mind,🔽 Are futile, so the Knower of Reality has said.🔽
All those who fail to understand🔽 The secret of the mind, the greatest of all things,🔽 Although they wish for joy and sorrow’s end,🔽 Will wander to no purpose, uselessly.🔽
Therefore I will take in hand🔽 And well protect this mind of mine.🔽
1️⃣ What use to me are many disciplines,🔽 If I can’t guard and discipline my mind?🔽
When in wild, unruly crowds,🔽 I’m careful and attentive of my wounds;🔽 Likewise, when in evil company,🔽 This wound, my mind, I’ll constantly protect.🔽
1️⃣ For if I carefully protect my wounds🔽 Because I fear the pain of minor injuries,🔽 Why should I not protect the wound that is my mind,🔽 For fear of being crushed beneath the cliffs of hell?🔽
If this is how I act and live,🔽 Then even in the midst of evil folk,🔽 Or even with fair women, all is well.🔽
My steady keeping of the vows will not decline.🔽
My property, my honor—all can freely go,🔽 My body and my livelihood as well.🔽
And even other virtues may decline,🔽 But never will I let my mind regress.🔽
All you who would protect your minds,🔽 Maintain your mindfulness and introspection;🔽 Guard them both, at cost of life and limb,🔽 I join my hands, beseeching you.🔽
Those disabled by ill health🔽 Are helpless, powerless to act.🔽
1️⃣ The mind, when likewise cramped by ignorance,🔽 Is impotent and cannot do its work.🔽
For those who have no introspection,🔽 Though they hear the teachings, ponder them, or meditate,🔽 Like water seeping from a leaking jar,🔽 Their learning will not settle in their memories.🔽
🔽They’re learned also and imbued with faith,🔽 But through the fault of lacking introspection,🔽 They will not escape the stain of sin and downfall.🔽
2️⃣ Lack of introspection is a thief;🔽 It slinks behind when mindfulness abates.🔽
1️⃣ And all the merit we have gathered in🔽 It steals; and down we go to lower realms.🔽
Defilements are a band of robbers🔽 Looking for their chance to injure us.🔽
1️⃣ They steal our virtue, when their moment comes,🔽 And batter out the lives of happy destinies.🔽
Therefore from the gateway of my mind🔽 My mindfulness shall not have leave to stray.🔽
1️⃣ And if it wanders, it shall be recalled🔽 By thoughts of anguish in the lower worlds.🔽
Through fear, and by the counsels of their abbots,🔽 And staying ever in their teacher’s company—🔽 In those endowed with fortune and devotion🔽 Mindfulness is cultivated easily.🔽 “
🔽The Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas both🔽 Possess unclouded vision, seeing everything:🔽 All lies open to their gaze,🔽 And likewise I am always in their presence.”🔽
One who has such thoughts as these🔽 Will gain devotion and a sense of fear and shame.🔽
For such a one, the memory of Buddha🔽 Rises frequently before the mind.🔽
When mindfulness is stationed as a sentinel,🔽 A guard upon the threshold of the mind,🔽 Introspection will be likewise there,🔽 Returning when forgotten or dispersed.🔽
If at the outset, when I check my mind,🔽 I find that it is tainted with some fault,🔽 I shall be still and self-possessed,🔽 Unmoving like a piece of wood.🔽
I shall never, vacantly,🔽 Allow my gaze to wander all around,🔽 But rather with a focused mind🔽 Will always go with eyes cast down.🔽
But that I may relax my gaze,🔽 I’ll sometimes raise my eyes and look around.🔽
2️⃣ And if there are some people standing in my sight,🔽 I’ll look at them and greet them with a friendly word.🔽
And yet, to spy the dangers on the road,🔽 I’ll scrutinize the four directions one by one.🔽
1️⃣ And when I stop to rest, I’ll turn around🔽 And look behind me, back along my way.🔽
I will survey the land, in front, behind,🔽 And carry on or else retrace my steps.🔽
1️⃣ In every time and place therefore🔽 I’ll know my needs and act accordingly.🔽 
“🔽My body shall remain like this.”🔽
1️⃣ Embarking thus upon a given course,🔽 From time to time I’ll verify🔽 Inquiring how my body is disposed.🔽
1️⃣ This rampant elephant, my mind,🔽 Once tied to that great post, reflection on the Teachings,🔽 Must now be watched with all my strength🔽 That it might never slip away.🔽
Those who strive to master concentration🔽 Should never for an instant be distracted.🔽
1️⃣ They should always watch their minds, inquiring,🔽 “Where is now my mind engaged?”🔽
When this becomes impossible,🔽 In case of danger or festivity, I’ll act as it seems best.🔽
1️⃣ For it is taught that rules of discipline🔽 May be relaxed in times of generosity.🔽 When something has been planned and started on,🔽 Attention should not drift to other things.🔽
1️⃣ With thoughts fixed on the chosen target,🔽 That and that alone should be pursued.🔽
Behaving in this way, all tasks are well performed,🔽 And nothing is achieved by doing otherwise.🔽
1️⃣ If thus we act, the secondary defilement,🔽 Lack of introspection, will not grow.🔽
And if you find yourself engaged🔽 In different kinds of pointless conversation🔽 And curious sights, the like of which abound—🔽 Be rid of all delight and taste for them.🔽
And if you find you’re grubbing in the soil,🔽 Or pulling up the grass or tracing idle patterns on the ground,🔽 Remembering the precepts of the Blissful One,🔽 In fear, restrain yourself at once.🔽
And when you feel the wish to move about,🔽 Or even to express yourself in speech,🔽 First examine what is in your mind.🔽
1️⃣ For steadfast ones should act correctly.🔽
When the urge arises in your mind🔽 To feelings of desire or angry hate,🔽 Do not act!
1️⃣ Be silent, do not speak!🔽
And like a log of wood be sure to stay.🔽
1️⃣ And when your mind is wild or filled with mockery,🔽 Or filled with pride and haughty arrogance,🔽 Or when you would expose another’s secret guilt,🔽 To bring up old dissensions or to act deceitfully,🔽 Or when you want to fish for praise,🔽 Or criticize and spoil another’s name,🔽 Or use harsh language, sparring for a fight,🔽 It’s then that like a log you should remain.🔽
And when you yearn for wealth, attention, fame,🔽 A circle of retainers serving you,🔽 And when you look for honors, recognition,🔽 It’s then that like a log you should remain.🔽
And when you are inclined to overlook another’s need🔽 And want to get the best thing for yourself,🔽 And when you feel the urge to speak,🔽 It’s then that like a log you should remain.🔽
Impatience, indolence, faintheartedness,🔽 And likewise arrogance and careless speech,🔽 Attachment to your side—when these arise,🔽 It’s then that like a log you should remain.🔽
2️⃣ Examine thus yourself from every side.🔽
1️⃣ Take note of your defilements and your pointless efforts.🔽
2️⃣ For thus the heroes on the Bodhisattva path🔽 Seize firmly on such faults with proper remedies.🔽
With perfect and unyielding faith,🔽 With steadfastness, respect, and courtesy,🔽 With conscientiousness and awe,🔽 Work calmly for the happiness of others.🔽
Let us not be downcast by the warring wants🔽 Of childish persons quarreling.🔽
2️⃣ Their thoughts are bred from conflict and emotion.🔽
1️⃣ Let us understand and treat them lovingly.🔽
When acting irreproachably,🔽 For our sake or the sake of others,🔽 Let us always bear in mind the thought🔽 That we are self-less, like an apparition.🔽
1️⃣ This supreme freedom of a human life,🔽 So long awaited, now at last attained!🔽
1️⃣ Reflecting always thus, maintain your mind🔽 As steady as Sumeru, king of mountains.🔽
If, O mind, you will not be aggrieved,🔽 When vultures with their love of flesh🔽 Are tugging at this body all around,🔽 Why are you so besotted with it now?🔽
Why, O mind, do you protect this body,🔽 Taking it to be your own?🔽
You and it are each a separate entity;🔽 How ever can it be of use to you?🔽
Why, O foolish mind,🔽 Don’t you appropriate a clean form carved in wood?🔽
1️⃣ How is it fit to guard🔽 An unclean engine for the making of impurity?🔽
First, with mind’s imagination,🔽 Shed the covering of skin,🔽 And with the blade of wisdom, strip🔽 The flesh from off the bony frame.🔽
And when you have divided all the bones,🔽 And searched right down amid the very marrow,🔽 You yourself should ask the question:🔽 Where is the essential core?🔽
If, persisting in the search,🔽 You see no underlying essence,🔽 Why do you protect with such desire🔽 The body that you now possess?🔽
Its filth you cannot eat, O mind;🔽 Its blood likewise is not for you to drink;🔽 Its innards, too, unsuitable to suck—🔽 This body, what then will you make of it?🔽
And yet it may indeed be kept🔽 As food to feed the vulture and the fox.🔽
1️⃣ The value of this human form🔽 Lies only in the use you make of it.🔽
Whatever you may do to guard and keep it,🔽 What will you do when🔽 The ruthless Lord of Death🔽 Will seize and throw it to the dogs and birds?🔽
If servants who cannot be set to work🔽 Are not rewarded with supplies and clothing,🔽 Why do you sustain with such great pains🔽 This body, which, though nourished, will abandon you?🔽
So pay this body due remuneration,🔽 And then be sure to make it work for you.🔽
1️⃣ But do not lavish everything🔽 On what will not bring perfect benefit.🔽
Regard your body as a vessel,🔽 A simple boat for going here and there.🔽
1️⃣ Make of it a thing that answers every wish🔽 To bring about the benefit of beings.🔽
1️⃣ Be the master of yourself🔽 And have an ever-smiling countenance.🔽
1️⃣ Rid yourself of scowling, wrathful frowns,🔽 And be a true and honest friend to all.🔽
2️⃣ Do not, acting inconsiderately,🔽 Move chairs and furniture so noisily around.🔽
1️⃣ Likewise do not open doors with violence.🔽
1️⃣ Take pleasure in the practice of humility.🔽
Herons, cats, and burglars🔽 Achieve what they intend🔽 By going silently and unobserved.🔽
1️⃣ Such is the constant practice of a sage.🔽
When useful admonitions come unsought🔽 From those with skill in counseling their fellows,🔽 Welcome them with humble gratitude,🔽 And always strive to learn from everyone.🔽
Praise all whose speech is worthy.🔽
1️⃣ Say, “Your words are excellent!”🔽
2️⃣ And when you notice others acting well,🔽 Encourage them in terms of warm approval.🔽
Extol their qualities discreetly;🔽 When they’re praised by others, praise them too.🔽
But when the qualities they praise are yours,🔽 Reflect upon their skill in recognizing qualities.🔽
2️⃣ The goal of every act is happiness itself,🔽 Though, even with great wealth, it’s rarely found.🔽
1️⃣ So take your pleasure in the excellence of others.🔽
3️⃣ Let them be a heartfelt joy to you.🔽
2️⃣ By acting thus, in this life you’ll lose nothing;🔽 In future lives, great bliss will come to you.🔽
1️⃣ Wrongdoing brings not joy but pain,🔽 And in the future dreadful torment.🔽
Speak coherently, appropriately,🔽 Clear in meaning, pleasantly.🔽
Rid yourself of craving and aversion;🔽 Speak gently with moderation.🔽
2️⃣ When you look at others think🔽 That it will be through them🔽 That you will come to Buddhahood.🔽
1️⃣ So look on them with frank and loving hearts.🔽1️⃣ Always fired by highest aspiration,🔽 Laboring to implement the antidotes,🔽 
You will reap great virtues in the field of excellence🔽 And in the fields of benefits and sorrow.🔽
Acting thus with faith and understanding,🔽 You should always undertake good works.🔽
1️⃣ And in whatever actions you perform,🔽 You should not be dependent on another.🔽
The perfections, giving and the rest,🔽 Progress in sequence, growing in importance.🔽
1️⃣ The great should never be abandoned for the less,🔽 And others’ good should be regarded as supreme.🔽
1️⃣ Therefore understand this well,🔽 And always labor for the benefit of beings.🔽
1️⃣ The Compassionate One farsightedly permits,🔽 To this end, even what has been proscribed.🔽
Eat only what is needful;🔽 Share with those who have embraced the discipline,🔽 With those who are defenseless or have fallen into evil states.🔽
Give everything except the three robes of religion.🔽
The body, used to practice sacred teachings,🔽 Should not be harmed in meaningless pursuits.🔽
1️⃣ By acting thus the wishes of all beings🔽 Will swiftly and completely be attained.🔽
They should not give up their bodies🔽 Whose compassionate thoughts are not yet pure.🔽
1️⃣ But let them be surrendered when, both now and in their futures lives,🔽 Great benefit is thereby gained.🔽
Do not teach the Dharma to the disrespectful:🔽 To those who, though not sick, wrap cloths around their heads,🔽 To those who carry weapons, staffs, or parasols,🔽 To those who are with covered heads.🔽
To those upon the lower paths do not explain the vast and deep,🔽 Nor tutor women unaccompanied by men.🔽
1️⃣ And every Dharma, high or low,🔽 Expound with equal reverence.🔽
Those suited to the teachings of great scope🔽 Should not be introduced to lesser paths.🔽
The rules of conduct you should not neglect🔽 Nor lead astray with talk of sūtras and of mantras.🔽
When you spit and throw away🔽 Your tooth sticks, you should cover them.🔽
1️⃣ And it is wrong to foul with urine and with other filth🔽 The fields and water fit for public use.🔽
When eating, do not gobble noisily,🔽 Nor stuff and cram your gaping mouth.🔽
And do not sit with legs outstretched,🔽 Nor coarsely rub your hands together.🔽
Do not travel, sit, or stay alone🔽 With women of another house.🔽
1️⃣ And all that you have seen, or have been told,🔽 To be a cause of scandal—that you should avoid.🔽
Not rudely pointing with your finger,🔽 But rather with a reverent gesture showing🔽 With the whole right hand outstretched—🔽 This is how to indicate the road.🔽
Do not wave your arms with uncouth gestures.🔽
1️⃣ Express yourself instead with unobtrusive signs,🔽 With gentle sounds and finger snaps.🔽
2️⃣ For acting otherwise is impolite excess.🔽
Lie down to sleep in the preferred direction,🔽 In the posture of the Buddha when he passed into nirvāṇa.🔽
1️⃣ And first with vigilance decide🔽 That you’ll be quick to rise again.🔽
The actions of the Bodhisattva🔽 Are unbounded, so the Teachings say.🔽
2️⃣ Of these, until the goal is won,🔽 Embrace the practices that purify your mind.🔽
Reciting thrice by day and thrice by night,🔽 The Sūtra in Three Sections,🔽 Relying on the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas,🔽 Purify the rest of your transgressions.🔽
Wherever and whenever and whatever you are doing,🔽 For your sake or the sake of others,🔽 Implement with diligence🔽 The teachings given for that situation.🔽
1️⃣ There is indeed no field of knowledge🔽 That the Buddhas’ offspring should not learn.🔽
1️⃣ For those who are well-versed in all these ways,🔽 There is no action destitute of merit.🔽
Directly, then, or indirectly,🔽 Do nothing that is not for others’ sake.🔽
1️⃣ And solely for their welfare dedicate🔽 Your every action to the gaining of enlightenment.🔽
Never, at the cost of life or limb,🔽 Forsake your virtuous friend, your teacher,🔽 Learned in the doctrine of the Mahāyāna,🔽 Supreme in Bodhisattva discipline.🔽
Learn how to attend upon your guru🔽 As described in Shrī Sambhava’s life.🔽
This and other teachings of the Buddha🔽 You should understand by reading in the sūtras.🔽
Indeed within these sūtras all the practices are found;🔽 Therefore read and study them.🔽
The Sūtra of the Essence of the Sky🔽 Is the text that should be studied first.🔽
All that must be practiced constantly🔽 Is clearly and extensively explained🔽 Within the Digest of All Disciplines,🔽 So this is something you should read repeatedly.🔽
From time to time, for sake of brevity,🔽 Consult the Digest of the Sūtras.🔽
1️⃣ And those two works peruse with diligence🔽 That noble Nāgārjuna has composed.🔽
Whatever in these works is not proscribed🔽 Be sure to undertake and implement.🔽
1️⃣ And what you find enjoined there, perfectly fulfill,🔽 And so protect the minds of worldly beings.🔽
Examining again and yet again🔽 The state and actions of your body and your mind—🔽 This alone defines in brief🔽 The maintenance of watchful introspection.🔽
But all this must be acted out in truth,🔽 For what is to be gained by mouthing syllables?🔽
1️⃣ What invalid was ever helped🔽 By merely reading in the doctor’s treatises?🔽
🔽
1️⃣ 6 Patience🔽 
All the good works gathered in a thousand ages,🔽 Such as deeds of generosity,🔽 And offerings to the Blissful Ones—🔽 A single flash of anger shatters them.🔽
No evil is there similar to anger,🔽 No austerity to be compared with patience.🔽
Steep yourself, therefore, in patience,🔽 In various ways, insistently.🔽
Those tormented by the pain of anger,🔽 Never know tranquillity of mind—🔽 Strangers they will be to every pleasure;🔽 They will neither sleep nor feel secure.🔽
Even those dependent on their lord🔽 For gracious gifts of honors and of wealth🔽 Will rise against and slay🔽 A master who is filled with wrath and hate.🔽
His family and friends he grieves,🔽 And is not served by those his gifts attract.🔽
1️⃣ No one is there, all in all,🔽 Who, being angry, lives at ease.🔽
All these ills are brought about by wrath,🔽 Our sorrow-bearing enemy.🔽
1️⃣ But those who seize and crush their anger down🔽 Will find their joy in this and future lives.🔽
Getting what I do not want,🔽 And all that hinders my desire—🔽 In discontent my anger finds its fuel.🔽
2️⃣ From this it grows and beats me down.🔽
Therefore I will utterly destroy🔽 The sustenance of this my enemy,🔽 My foe who has no other purpose🔽 But to hurt and injure me.🔽
So come what may, I’ll not upset🔽 My cheerful happiness of mind.🔽
1️⃣ Dejection never brings me what I want;🔽 My virtue will be warped and marred by it.🔽
If there’s a remedy when trouble strikes,🔽 What reason is there for dejection?🔽
1️⃣ And if there is no help for it,🔽 What use is there in being glum?🔽
Pain, humiliation, insults, or rebukes—🔽 We do not want them🔽 Either for ourselves or those we love.🔽
1️⃣ For those we do not like, it’s the reverse!🔽
The cause of happiness is rare,🔽 And many are the seeds of suffering!🔽
1️⃣ But if I have no pain, I’ll never long for freedom;🔽 Therefore, O my mind, be steadfast!🔽
The Karna folk and those devoted to the Goddess,🔽 Endure the meaningless austerities🔽 Of being cut and burned.🔽
1️⃣ So why am I so timid on the path of freedom?🔽
There’s nothing that does not grow light🔽 Through habit and familiarity.🔽
1️⃣ Putting up with little cares🔽 I’ll train myself to bear with great adversity!🔽
Don’t I see that this is so with common irritations:🔽 Bites and stings of snakes and flies,🔽 Experiences of hunger and of thirst,🔽 And painful rashes on my skin?🔽
Heat and cold, the wind and rain,🔽 Sickness, prison, beatings—🔽 I’ll not fret about such things.🔽
1️⃣ To do so only aggravates my trouble.🔽
There are some whose bravery increases,🔽 At the sight of their own blood,🔽 While some lose all their strength and faint🔽 When it’s another’s blood they see!🔽
This results from how the mind is set,🔽 In steadfastness or cowardice.🔽
1️⃣ And so I’ll scorn all injury,🔽 And hardships I will disregard!🔽
When sorrows fall upon the wise,🔽 Their minds should be serene and undisturbed.🔽
2️⃣ For in their war against defiled emotion,🔽 Many are the hardships, as in every battle.🔽
Thinking scorn of every pain,🔽 And vanquishing such foes as hatred:🔽 These are exploits of victorious warriors.🔽
1️⃣ The rest is slaying what is dead already!🔽
2️⃣ Suffering also has its worth.🔽
1️⃣ Through sorrow, pride is driven out🔽 And pity felt for those who wander in saṃsāra;🔽 Evil is avoided; goodness seems delightful.🔽
I am not angry with my bile and other humors—🔽 Fertile source of suffering and pain!🔽
2️⃣ So why should living beings give offence,🔽 They likewise are impelled by circumstance?🔽
Although they are unlooked for, undesired,🔽 These ills afflict us all the same.🔽
And likewise, though unwanted and unsought,🔽 Defilements nonetheless insistently arise.🔽
Never thinking, “Now I will be angry,”🔽 People are impulsively caught up in anger.🔽
1️⃣ Irritation, likewise, comes🔽 Though never plans to be experienced!🔽
All defilements of whatever kind,🔽 The whole variety of evil deeds🔽 Are brought about by circumstances:🔽 None is independent, none autonomous.🔽
Conditions, once assembled, have no thought🔽 That they will now give rise to some result.🔽
1️⃣ Nor does that which is engendered🔽 Think that it has been produced.🔽
The primal substance, as they say,🔽 And that which has been called the self,🔽 Do not arise designedly,🔽 And do not think, “I will become.”🔽
1️⃣ For that which is not born does not exist,🔽 So what could want to come to be?🔽
1️⃣ And permanently drawn toward its object,🔽 It can never cease from being so.🔽
2️⃣ Indeed!1️⃣ This self, if permanent,🔽 
Is certainly inert like space itself.🔽
And should it meet with other factors,🔽 How could they affect it, since it is unchanging?🔽
If, when conditions act on it, it stays just as it was before,🔽 What influence have these conditions had?🔽
1️⃣ They say that these are agents of the self,🔽 But what connection could there be between them?🔽
All things, then, depend on other things,🔽 And these likewise depend; they are not independent.🔽
1️⃣ Knowing this, we will not be annoyed🔽 At things that are like magical appearances.🔽 
“Resistance,” you may say, “is out of place,🔽 For what will be opposed by whom?”🔽
2️⃣ The stream of sorrow is cut through by patience;🔽 There is nothing out of place in our assertion!🔽
Thus, when enemies or friends🔽 Are seen to act improperly,🔽 Remain serene and call to mind🔽, That everything arises from conditions.🔽
1️⃣ If things could be according to their wish,🔽 No suffering would ever come🔽, To anyone of all embodied beings,🔽 For none of them wants pain of any kind.🔽
2️⃣ Yet carelessly, all unaware,🔽 They tear themselves on thorns;🔽 And ardent in pursuit of wives and goods,🔽 They starve themselves of nourishment.🔽
Some hang themselves or leap into the void,🔽 Take poison or consume unhealthy food,🔽 Or by their evil conduct🔽 Bring destruction on themselves.🔽
For when affliction seizes them,🔽 They even slay themselves, the selves they love so much.🔽
1️⃣ So how can they not be the cause🔽 Of others’ bodily distress?🔽
Although we almost never feel compassion🔽 For those who, through defilement,🔽 Bring about their own perdition,🔽 What purpose does our anger serve?🔽
If those who are like wanton children🔽 Are by nature prone to injure others,🔽 There’s no reason for our rage;🔽 It’s like resenting fire for being hot.🔽
And if their faults are fleeting and contingent,🔽 If living beings are by nature mild,🔽 It’s likewise senseless to resent them—🔽 As well be angry at the sky when it is full of smoke!🔽
Although it is their sticks that hurt me,🔽 I am angry at the ones who wield them, striking me.🔽
1️⃣ But they in turn are driven by their hatred;🔽 Therefore with their hatred I should take offence.🔽
In just the same way in the past🔽 I it was who injured living beings.🔽
1️⃣ Therefore it is right that injury🔽 Should come to me their torturer.🔽
Their weapons and my body—🔽 Both are causes of my torment!🔽
1️⃣ They their weapons, I my body brandished;🔽 Who then is more worthy of my rage?🔽
This body—running sore in human form—🔽 Merely touched, it cannot stand the pain!🔽
1️⃣ I’m the one who grasped it in my blind attachment,🔽 Whom should I resent when pain occurs?🔽
We who are like children🔽 Shrink from pain, but love its causes.🔽
1️⃣ We hurt ourselves through our misdeeds!🔽
1️⃣ So why should others be the object of our rage?🔽
3️⃣ And who indeed should I be angry with?🔽This pain is all my own contriving—🔽 
Likewise all the janitors of hell🔽 And 
all the groves of razor trees!🔽
Those who harm me rise against me—🔽 It’s my karma that has summoned them.🔽

And if through this these beings go to hell,🔽 Is it not I who bring their ruin?🔽
Because of them, and through my patience,🔽 All my many sins are cleansed and purified.🔽
1️⃣ But they will be the ones who, thanks to me,🔽 Will have the long-drawn agonies of hell.🔽
Therefore I am their tormentor!🔽
1️⃣ Therefore it is they who bring me benefit!🔽
1️⃣ Thus with what perversity, pernicious mind,🔽 Will you be angry with your enemies?🔽
If a patient quality of mind is mine,🔽 I shall avoid the pains of hell.🔽
1️⃣ But though indeed I save myself,🔽 What of my foes, what fate’s in store for them?🔽
1️⃣ If I repay them harm for harm,🔽 Indeed they’ll not be saved thereby.🔽
1️⃣ My conduct will in turn be marred,🔽 Austerity of patience brought to nothing.🔽
Because the mind is bodiless🔽 It cannot be destroyed by anyone.🔽
Because of mind’s attachment to the body,🔽 This body is oppressed by pain.🔽
Scorn and hostile words,🔽 And comments that I do not like to hear—🔽 My body is not harmed by them.🔽
What reason do you have, O mind, for your resentment?🔽
The enmity that others show me,🔽 Since in this or future lives🔽 It cannot actually devour me,🔽 Why should I be so averse to it?🔽
Perhaps I turn from it because🔽 It hinders me from having what I want.🔽
1️⃣ But all my property I’ll leave behind,🔽 While sins will keep me steady company.🔽
Better far for me to die today,🔽 Than live a long and evil life.🔽
1️⃣ However long the days of those like me,🔽 The pain of dying will be all the same.🔽
One man dreams he lives a hundred years🔽 Of happiness, but then he wakes.🔽
1️⃣ Another dreams an instant’s joy,🔽 But then he likewise wakes.🔽
And when they wake, the happiness of both🔽 Is finished, never to return.🔽
1️⃣ Likewise, when the hour of death comes round,🔽 Our lives are over, whether brief or long.🔽
Though we be rich in worldly goods,🔽 Delighting in our wealth for many years,🔽 Despoiled and stripped as though by thieves,🔽 We must go naked and with empty hands.🔽
Perhaps we’ll claim that by our wealth we live,🔽 And living, gather merit, dissipating evil.🔽
But if we are aggressive for the sake of profit,🔽 Won’t our gains be evil, all our merits lost?🔽
And if the aim for which we live🔽 Is thereby wasted and undone,🔽 What use is there in living thus,🔽 When evil is the only consequence?🔽
And if, when people slander us,🔽 We claim our anger is because they injure others,🔽 How is it we do not resent🔽 Their slander when it’s aimed at someone else?🔽
And if we bear with this antipathy🔽 Because it’s due to other factors,🔽 Why are we impatient when they slander us?🔽
2️⃣ Defilement, after all, has been the cause of it.🔽
Even those who vilify and undermine🔽 The Sacred Doctrine, images, and stūpas🔽 Are not proper objects of our anger.🔽
1️⃣ Buddhas are themselves untouched thereby.🔽
And even if our teachers, relatives, and friends🔽 Are now the object of aggression,🔽 All derives from factors, as we have explained.🔽
1️⃣ This we should perceive and curb our wrath.🔽
1️⃣ Beings suffer injury alike🔽 From lifeless things as well as living beings.🔽
2️⃣ So why be angry only with the latter?🔽
1️⃣ Rather let us simply bear with harm.🔽
Some do evil things because of ignorance,🔽 Some respond with anger, being ignorant.🔽
1️⃣ Which of them is faultless in such acts?🔽
1️⃣ To whom shall error be ascribed?🔽
Instead, why did they act in times gone by🔽 That they are now so harmed at others’ hands?🔽
1️⃣ Since everything depends on karma,🔽 Why should I be angry at such things?🔽
This I see and therefore, come what may,🔽 I’ll hold fast to the virtuous path🔽 And foster in the hearts of all🔽 An attitude of mutual love.🔽
Now when a building is ablaze🔽 And flames leap out from house to house,🔽 The wise course is to take and fling away🔽 The straw and anything that spreads the fire.🔽
And so, in fear that merit might be all consumed,🔽 We should at once cast far away🔽 Our mind’s attachments:🔽 Tinder for the fiery flames of hate.🔽
Is it not a happy chance if when, condemned to death,🔽 A man is freed, his hand cut off in ransom for his life?🔽
1️⃣ And is it not a happy chance if now, to escape hell,🔽 I suffer only the misfortunes of the human state?🔽
If even these, my present pains,🔽 Are now beyond my strength to bear,🔽 Why do I not cast off my anger,🔽 Cause of future sorrows in infernal torment?🔽
For sake of gaining all that I desired,🔽 A thousand times I underwent🔽 The tortures of the realms of hell—🔽 Achieving nothing for myself and others.🔽
The present aches are nothing to compare with those,🔽 And yet great benefits will come from them.🔽
1️⃣ These troubles that dispel the pain of wanderers—🔽 It’s only right that I rejoice in them.🔽
When others take delight🔽 In giving praise to those endowed with talents,🔽 Why, O mind, do you not find🔽 A joy likewise in praising them?🔽
The pleasure that is gained therefrom🔽 Itself gives rise to blameless happiness.🔽
1️⃣ It’s urged on us by all the holy ones,🔽 And is the perfect way of winning others.🔽 
“1️⃣ But they’re the ones who’ll have the happiness,” you say.🔽
1️⃣ If this then is a joy you would resent,🔽 Abandon paying wages and returning favors.🔽
2️⃣ You will be the loser—both in this life and the next!🔽
When praise is heaped upon your qualities,🔽 You’re keen that others should be pleased thereby.🔽
1️⃣ But when the compliment is paid to others,🔽 You feel no inclination to rejoice as well.🔽
You who want the happiness of beings🔽 Have wished to be enlightened for their sake.🔽
1️⃣ So why should others irk you when🔽 They find some pleasure for themselves?🔽
And if you claim to wish that beings🔽 Be enlightened, honored by the triple world,🔽 When petty marks of favor come their way,🔽 Why are you so discomforted?🔽
When dependents who rely on you,🔽 To whom you are obliged to give support,🔽 Find for themselves the means of livelihood,🔽 Will you not be happy, will you once again be angry?🔽
If even this you do not want for beings,🔽 How could you want Buddhahood for them?🔽
And how can anyone have bodhichitta🔽 Who is angry when another prospers?🔽
If someone else receives a gift,🔽 Or if that gift stays in the benefactor’s house,🔽 In neither case will it be yours—🔽 So, given or withheld, why is it your concern?🔽
All your merit and the faith of others,🔽 All your sterling qualities—why throw them all away?🔽
1️⃣ Not holding onto what might bring you riches,🔽 Tell me, why are you not angry at yourself?🔽
Not only do you feel no sorrow🔽 For the evils you have done,🔽 You even wish to match yourself🔽 With those whose merit has been earned!🔽
If unhappiness befalls your enemies,🔽 Why should this be cause for your rejoicing?🔽
The wishes of your mind alone,🔽 Will not in fact contrive their injury.🔽
And if your hostile wishes were to bring them harm,🔽 Again, what cause of joy is that to you?🔽 
“2️⃣ Why, then I would be satisfied!”—are these your thoughts?🔽
1️⃣ Is anything more ruinous than that?🔽
Caught upon the hook, unbearable and sharp,🔽 Cast by the fisherman, my own defilements,🔽 I’ll be flung into the cauldrons of the pit,🔽 And surely boiled by all the janitors of hell!🔽
Veneration, praise, and fame🔽 Serve not to increase merit or my span of life,🔽 Bestowing neither health nor strength🔽 And nothing for the body’s ease.🔽
If I am wise in what is good for me,🔽 I’ll ask what benefit these bring.🔽
1️⃣ For if it’s entertainment I desire,🔽 I might as well resort to alcohol and cards!🔽
I lose my life, my wealth I squander,🔽 All for reputation’s sake.🔽
What use are words, and whom will they delight🔽 When I am dead and in my grave?🔽
Children can’t help crying when🔽 Their sand castles come crumbling down.🔽
1️⃣ My mind is so like them🔽 When praise and reputation start to fail.🔽
Short-lived sound, devoid of intellect,🔽 Can never in itself intend to praise me.🔽
I say that it’s the joy that others take in me,🔽 It’s this that is the cause of my delight.🔽
But what is it to me if others take delight🔽 In someone else, or even in myself?🔽
1️⃣ Their pleasure’s theirs and theirs alone.🔽
1️⃣ No part of it is felt by me.🔽
If I am happy at the joy of those who take delight,🔽 Then everyone should be a source of joy to me.🔽
When people take delight in others🔽 Why am I not happy at their pleasure?🔽
The satisfaction that is mine🔽 From thinking, “I am being praised,”🔽 Is unacceptable to common sense🔽 And nothing but the antics of a silly child.🔽
Praise and compliments distract me,🔽 Sapping my revulsion with saṃsāra.🔽
1️⃣ I start to envy others their good qualities🔽 And thus all excellence is ruined.🔽
2️⃣ Those who stay close by me, then,🔽 To damage my good name and cut me down to size—🔽 Are surely there protecting me🔽 From falling into realms of grief.🔽
For I am one who strives for freedom.🔽
1️⃣ I must not be caught by wealth and honors.🔽
1️⃣ How could I be angry with the ones🔽 Who work to free me from my fetters?🔽
They, like Buddha’s very blessing,🔽 Bar my way, determined as I am🔽 To plunge myself headlong in sorrow:🔽 How can I be angry with them?🔽
I should not be irritated, saying,🔽 “They are obstacles to my good deeds.”🔽
1️⃣ For is not patience the supreme austerity,🔽 And should I not abide by this?🔽
And if I fail to practice patience,🔽 Hindered by my own shortcomings,🔽 I myself create impediments🔽 To merit’s causes, yet so close at hand.🔽
If something does not come to be when something else is absent,🔽 And does arise, that factor being present,🔽 That factor is indeed its cause.🔽
How can it, then, be said to hinder it?🔽
The beggars who arrive at proper times🔽 Are not an obstacle to generosity.🔽
1️⃣ We cannot say that those who give the vows🔽 Are hindrances to ordination!🔽
The beggars in this world are numerous;🔽 Assailants are comparatively few.🔽
1️⃣ For if I do no harm to others,🔽 Others do no injury to me.🔽
So, like a treasure found at home,🔽 That I have gained without fatigue,🔽 My enemies are helpers in my Bodhisattva work🔽 And therefore they should be a joy to me.🔽
Since I have grown in patience🔽 Thanks to them,🔽 To them its first fruits I should give,🔽 For of my patience they have been the cause.🔽
And if I say my foes should not be honored🔽, Since they did not mean to stimulate my patience,🔽 Why do I revere the Sacred Dharma,🔽 Cause indeed of my attainment?🔽 
“These enemies conspired to harm me,” I protest,🔽 “And therefore should receive no honors.”🔽
But had they worked to help me like a doctor,🔽 
How could I have brought forth patience?🔽
Thanks to those whose minds are full of malice🔽 I engender patience in myself.🔽
1️⃣ They therefore are the causes of my patience,🔽 Fit for veneration, like the Dharma.🔽
And so the mighty Sage has spoken of the field of beings🔽 As well as of the field of Conquerors.🔽
1️⃣ Many who brought happiness to beings,🔽 Have passed beyond, attaining to perfection.🔽
2️⃣ Thus the state of Buddhahood depends🔽 On beings and on Buddhas equally.🔽
1️⃣ What kind of practice is it then🔽 That honors only Buddhas but not beings?🔽
1️⃣ Not in the qualities of their minds🔽 But in the fruits they give are they alike.🔽
1️⃣ In beings, too, such excellence resides,🔽 And therefore beings and Buddhas are the same.🔽
Offerings made to those with loving minds🔽 Reveal the eminence of living beings.🔽
1️⃣ Merit that accrues from faith in Buddha🔽 Shows in turn the Buddha’s eminence.🔽
Although not one of them is equal🔽 To the Buddhas, who are oceans of perfection,🔽 Because they have a share in bringing forth enlightenment,🔽 Beings may be likened to the Buddhas.🔽
If of such a gathering of supreme excellence🔽 A tiny part appeared in certain beings,🔽 The three worlds made in offering to them🔽 Would be a very little thing.🔽
Since there lies in beings a share🔽 In bringing forth the supreme and enlightened state,🔽 By virtue of this parity alone🔽 It’s right that I should reverence them.🔽
1️⃣ The Buddhas are my true, unfailing friends.🔽
2️⃣ Boundless are the benefits they bring to me.🔽
1️⃣ How else may I repay their goodness🔽, But by making living beings happy?🔽
2️⃣ By helping beings we repay the ones🔽 Who sacrifice their lives for us and plunge into the hell of Unrelenting Pain.🔽
1️⃣ Should beings therefore do great harm to me,🔽 I’ll strive to bring them only benefit.🔽
For those who have become my lords,🔽 At times, took care not even of their bodies.🔽
1️⃣ Why should I, a fool, behave with such conceit?🔽
2️⃣ Why should I not become the slave of others?🔽
2️⃣ Buddhas are made happy by the joy of beings.🔽
2️⃣ They sorrow, they lament when beings suffer.🔽
2️⃣ By bringing joy to beings, then, I please the Buddhas also;🔽 
By wounding them, I wound the Buddhas too.🔽
Just as there’s no sensual delight🔽 To please the mind of one whose body burns in fire,🔽 There is no way to please the great compassionate ones🔽 While we ourselves are causes of another’s pain.🔽
1️⃣ The damage I have done to beings🔽 Saddens all the Buddhas in their great compassion.🔽
1️⃣ Therefore, all these evils I confess today🔽 And pray that they will bear with my offences.🔽
That I might rejoice the Buddhas’ hearts,🔽 Henceforth I will be master of myself, the servant of the world.🔽
2️⃣ I shall not seek revenge though crowds may trample on my head or kill me.🔽
1️⃣ Let the Guardians of the world rejoice!🔽
The great compassionate lords consider as themselves🔽 All beings—there’s no doubt of this.🔽
1️⃣ Those whom I perceive as beings are Buddhas in themselves;🔽 How can I not treat them with respect?🔽2️⃣ This very thing is pleasing to the Buddhas’ hearts🔽 
And perfectly secures the welfare of myself.🔽
This will drive away the sorrows of the world,🔽 And therefore it will be my constant work.🔽
1️⃣ Imagine that the steward of a king🔽 Does injury to multitudes of people.🔽
1️⃣ Those with clear, farseeing eyes🔽 Do not respond with violence even if they can.🔽
For stewards, after all, are not alone.🔽
1️⃣ They are supported by the kingly power.🔽
1️⃣ Therefore I will not despise🔽 The feeble beings tormenting me.🔽
Their allies are the guardians of hell🔽 And also the compassionate Buddhas.🔽
1️⃣ Therefore living beings I will gratify🔽 As subjects might placate a wrathful king.🔽
And yet, the pains of hell to be endured🔽 Through making living beings suffer—🔽 Could these ever be unleashed on me🔽 By all the ire of such a king?🔽
And even if that king were pleased,🔽 Enlightenment he could not give to me.🔽
1️⃣ For this will only be achieved🔽 By bringing happiness to beings.🔽
No need to mention future Buddhahood,🔽 Achieved through bringing happiness to beings.🔽
How can I not see that glory, fame, and pleasure🔽 Even in this life will likewise come?🔽
For patience in saṃsāra brings such things🔽 As beauty, health, and good renown.🔽
1️⃣ Its fruit is great longevity,🔽 The vast contentment of a universal king.🔽
🔽
2️⃣ 7 Diligence🔽 
Thus with patience I will strive with diligence.🔽
1️⃣ For in such diligence enlightenment is found.🔽
1️⃣ If no wind blows, then nothing stirs,🔽 And neither is there merit without diligence.🔽
Diligence means joy in virtuous ways.🔽
Its contraries have been defined as laziness,🔽 An inclination for unwholesomeness,🔽 Defeatism and self-contempt.🔽
A taste for idle pleasure🔽 And a craving for repose and sleep,🔽 No qualms about the sorrows of saṃsāra:🔽 Laziness indeed is born from these.🔽
Snared by the trapper of defiled emotion,🔽 Enmeshed and taken in the toils of birth,🔽 Again you’ve strayed into the maw of Death.🔽
What is it? Have you still not understood?🔽
Don’t you see how, one by one,🔽 Death has come for all your kind?🔽
1️⃣ And yet you slumber on so soundly,🔽 Like a buffalo beside its butcher.🔽
1️⃣ All the paths of flight are blocked,🔽 The Lord of Death now has you in his sights.🔽
How can you take such pleasure in your food,🔽 And how can you delight to rest and sleep?🔽
Death will swoop on you so swiftly.🔽
1️⃣ Gather merit till that moment comes!🔽
For even if you then throw off your indolence,🔽 What will you do when there is no more time?🔽 
“1️⃣ This I have not done, and this I’m only starting.🔽 
1️⃣ And this—I’m only halfway through . . .”🔽
1️⃣ Then is the sudden coming of the Lord of Death,🔽 And oh, the thought “Alas, I’m finished!”🔽
You’ll look upon the faces of your hopeless friends,🔽 Their tearstained cheeks, their red and swollen eyes🔽 (For such will be the depths of their distress),🔽 And then you’ll see the heralds of the Deadly Lord.🔽
The memory of former sins will torture you,🔽 The screams and din of hell break on your ears.🔽
1️⃣ With very terror you will foul yourself.🔽
What will you do in such delirium?🔽
If, like a living fish that twists and writhes,🔽 You are so terrified while still alive,🔽 What need to speak of pain unbearable🔽 In hells created by past evil deeds?🔽
How can you remain at ease like this🔽 When you have done the deeds that lead🔽 To contact on your tender baby-flesh🔽 Of boiling liquids in the hell of Extreme Heat?🔽
So testy and thin-skinned, you want results without endeavor—🔽 Many are the troubles now in store for you!🔽
1️⃣ Though in the grip of death, you are behaving like a god,🔽 And suffering, alas, will beat you down!🔽
So take advantage of this human boat.🔽
Free yourself from sorrow’s mighty stream!🔽
This vessel will be later hard to find.🔽
1️⃣ The time that you have now, you fool, is not for sleep!🔽
You turn your back upon the Sacred Doctrine,🔽 Supreme joy and boundless source of bliss.🔽
1️⃣ Why delight in mere excitement,🔽 In distractions that will cause you misery?🔽
Do not be downcast, but marshal all your powers;🔽 Make an effort; be the master of yourself!🔽
1️⃣ Practice the equality of self and other;🔽 Practice the exchange of self and other.🔽 
“Oh, but how could I become enlightened?”🔽
1️⃣ Don’t excuse yourself with such despondency!🔽
The Buddha, who declares the truth,🔽 Has truly spoken and proclaimed🔽 That if they bring forth strength of perseverance,🔽 Even bees and flies🔽 And gnats and grubs will gain🔽 Supreme enlightenment so hard to find.🔽
And if, by birth and lineage of human kind,🔽 I’m able to distinguish good from ill🔽 And do not leave aside the Bodhisattva deeds,🔽 Why should I not attain the state of Buddhahood?🔽 
“That I must give away my life and limbs🔽 Alarms and frightens me”—if so you say,🔽 
Your terror is misplaced.1 Confused,🔽 You fail to see what’s hard and what is easy.🔽
For myriads of ages, measureless, uncounted,🔽 Your body has been cut, impaled,🔽 Burned, torn—for times past numbering!🔽
1️⃣ Yet none of this has brought you Buddhahood.🔽
The hardships suffered on the path to Buddhahood🔽 Are limited in their extent🔽 And likened to the pain of an incision🔽 Made to cure the harms of inward ills.🔽
And all our doctors cure disease🔽 By means of bitter remedies.🔽
Likewise, to destroy a vast amount of pain,🔽 We should be patient with our little hurts.🔽
And yet the Supreme Healer does not use,🔽 Like them, these common remedies.🔽
2️⃣ With ways of extreme tenderness🔽 He soothes away intense and boundless suffering.🔽
Our guide instructs us to begin🔽 By giving vegetable greens or other little things,🔽 That later, step-by-step, the habit once acquired,🔽 We may be able to donate our very flesh.🔽
For when we truly feel🔽 Our bodies are no different from the given herbs,🔽 What hardship can there be🔽 In giving up, relinquishing, our very flesh?🔽
Sin has been abandoned, thus there is no pain;🔽 Through having wisdom there is no more sorrow.🔽
1️⃣ For so it is that mind and body both🔽 Are injured by false views and sinfulness.🔽
Merit is the true cause of the body’s ease,🔽 While happiness of mind is had through understanding.🔽
1️⃣ What can sadden those who have compassion,🔽 Who remain within saṃsāra for the sake of beings?🔽
For through their power of bodhichitta,🔽 Former sins are totally consumed,🔽 And merit, ocean-vast, is gathered in,🔽 It’s therefore said that they excel the Shrāvakas.🔽
Mounted on the horse of bodhichitta,🔽 Which puts to flight all mournful weariness,🔽 What lucid person could be in despair🔽 Proceeding in this way from joy to joy?🔽
The forces that secure the good of beings,🔽 Are aspiration, steadfastness, relinquishment, and joy.🔽
Aspiration grows through fear of suffering🔽 And contemplation of the benefits to be attained.🔽
Therefore leaving everything that is adverse to it,🔽 I’ll labor to increase my diligence,🔽 Through aspiration and self-confidence, relinquishment and joy,🔽 By strength of earnest application and exertion of control.🔽
The boundless evils of myself and others—🔽 I must bring them all to nothing,🔽 Even though a single of these ills🔽 May take unnumbered ages to exhaust!🔽
And if I find within myself🔽 No sign that faults are even starting to be cleansed,🔽 Why does my heart not burst asunder,🔽 Destined as I am for boundless pain?🔽
Good qualities for my and others’ sake,🔽 Though they be many, I must now accomplish,🔽 Even though for each of them🔽 I must endeavor for unnumbered ages.🔽
Acquaintance I have never gained🔽 With even part of such great qualities.🔽
It is indeed amazing that I render meaningless🔽 This life that somehow I have gained.🔽
Offerings to the Buddhas I have never made;🔽 No feasts were ever held through my donations;🔽 No works have I accomplished for the Teachings;🔽 The wishes of the poor I left unsatisfied.🔽
I have not saved the frightened from their fear;🔽 The wretched I have not consoled.🔽
1️⃣ My mother’s pain, her womb’s discomfort:🔽 These alone are my accomplishments.🔽
My failure to aspire to Dharma🔽 Now and in the past🔽 Has brought me to my present dereliction.🔽
2️⃣ Who therefore would spurn such aspiration?🔽
Aspiration, so the Sage asserted,🔽 Is the root of every kind of virtue.🔽
1️⃣ Aspiration’s root in turn🔽 Is constant meditation on the fruits of action.🔽
The body’s pains, anxieties of mind,🔽 And all my fears of various kinds,🔽 To be deprived of what I want—🔽 Such is the harvest of my sinful deeds.🔽
But if my acts are good, sincerely intended,🔽 Then no matter where I turn my steps,🔽 The merit gained will honor me🔽 With its resulting benefits.🔽
But if, through seeking happiness, my deeds are wrong,🔽 No matter where I turn my steps,🔽 The knives of misery will cut me down,🔽 The wage and retribution of a sinful life.🔽
Through virtue I will rest within the cool heart of a fragrant spreading lotus,🔽 With splendor nurtured by the sweet words of the Conqueror.🔽
1️⃣ Then from the lotus opened in the Sage’s light, in supreme form I will arise🔽 To dwell, the blissful Buddha’s heir, in presence of Victorious Ones.🔽
2️⃣ Or else as wages of my many sins, my skin completely flayed, I shall be utterly brought low🔽 By creatures of the Lord of Death, 
who on my body pour a liquid bronze all melted in the dreadful blaze.And pierced by burning swords and knives, my flesh🔽 Dismembered in a hundred parts will fall upon the white-hot iron ground.🔽
Therefore I will aspire and tend to virtue,🔽 And steep myself in it with great devotion.🔽
1️⃣ And with the method stated in the Vajradhvaja,🔽 I will train in confident assurance.🔽
Let me first consider my reserves—🔽 To start or not to start accordingly.🔽
1️⃣ It might be better not to start,🔽 But once begun, I should not then withdraw.🔽
For if I do such things, the pattern will return🔽 In later lives, and sin and pain will grow.🔽
1️⃣ And other actions will be left undone🔽 Or else will bear a meager fruit.🔽
Action, the afflictions, and ability:🔽 Three things to which my pride should be directed.🔽 
“I will do this, I myself, alone!”🔽
1️⃣ These words define my pride of action.🔽
Overpowered by their minds’ afflictions,🔽 Worldly folk are helpless to secure their happiness.🔽
2️⃣ Compared with those who wander, I am able!🔽
1️⃣ This therefore shall be my task.🔽
When others give themselves to low behavior,🔽 What shall be my stance in their regard?🔽
1️⃣ In any case, I’ll not be arrogant;🔽 My best way is to give up such conceit.🔽
When they find a dying serpent,🔽 Even crows behave like soaring eagles.🔽
Therefore if I’m weak and feeble-hearted,🔽 Even little faults will strike and injure me.🔽
But if, depressed, I give up trying,🔽 How can I gain freedom from my abject state?🔽
1️⃣ But if I stand my ground with proud resolve,🔽 It will be hard for even great faults to attack me.🔽
Therefore with a steadfast heart🔽 I’ll get the better of my weaknesses.🔽
1️⃣ But if my failings get the upper hand,🔽 My wish to overcome the triple world is laughable indeed.🔽 
“I will be victor over all,🔽 And nothing shall prevail and bring me down!”🔽
1️⃣ The offspring of the Lion, the Conqueror,🔽 Should constantly abide in this self-confidence.🔽
Those whom arrogance destroys🔽 Are thus defiled; they lack self-confidence.🔽
1️⃣ Those who have true confidence escape the foe,🔽 While others fall into the power of an evil pride.🔽
2️⃣ When arrogance inflates the mind,🔽 It draws it down to states of misery—🔽 
Or ruins happiness, should human birth be gained.🔽1️⃣ Thus one is born a slave, dependent for one’s sustenance,🔽 Or feebleminded, ugly, without strength,🔽 The butt and laughingstock of everyone.🔽
1️⃣ These “ascetics” puffed up with conceit!🔽
1️⃣ If these you call the proud, then tell me who are wretched?🔽
Those who uphold pride to vanquish pride, the enemy,🔽 Are truly proud, victorious, and brave.🔽
1️⃣ And they who stem the increase of that evil pride,🔽 Perfect, according to their wish, the fruit of victory for beings.🔽
When I am beleaguered by defilements,🔽 I will stand and face them in a thousand ways.🔽
I’ll not surrender to the host of the afflictions🔽 But like a lion I will stand amid a crowd of foxes.🔽
However great may be their peril,🔽 People will by reflex guard their eyes.🔽
1️⃣ And likewise I, whatever dangers come,🔽 Must not fall down beneath defilement’s power.🔽
Better for me to be burned to death,🔽 And better to be killed, my head cut off!🔽
1️⃣ At no time will I bow and scrape🔽 Before that foe of mine, defiled emotion.🔽 
2️⃣ Thus in every time and place🔽 I will not wander from the wholesome path.🔽
Like those who take great pleasure in their games,🔽 Whatever task the Bodhisattvas do,🔽 Let them devote themselves without reserve,🔽 With joyfulness that never knows satiety.🔽
People labor hard to gain contentment🔽 Though success is very far from sure.🔽
But how can they be happy if they do not do🔽 Those deeds that are the source of joy to them?🔽
And since they never have enough of pleasure,🔽 Honey on the razor’s edge,🔽 How could they have enough of merit,🔽 Fruits of which are happiness and peace?🔽
The elephant, tormented by the noonday sun,🔽 Will dive into the waters of a lake,🔽 And likewise I must plunge into my work🔽 That I might bring it to completion.🔽
If impaired by weakness or fatigue,🔽 I’ll lay the work aside, the better to resume.🔽
2️⃣ And I will leave the task when it’s complete,🔽 All avid for the work that’s next to come.🔽
As seasoned fighters face the swords🔽 Of enemies upon the battle line,🔽 I’ll lightly dodge the weapons of defilement,🔽 And strike my enemy upon the quick.🔽
If, in the fray, the soldier drops his sword,🔽 In fright, he swiftly takes it up again.🔽
So likewise, if the arm of mindfulness is lost,🔽 In fear of hell, I’ll quickly get it back!🔽
Just as poison fills the body,🔽 Borne on the current of the blood,🔽 Likewise evil, when it finds its chance,🔽 Will spread and permeate the mind.🔽
I will be like a frightened man, a brimming oil-jar in his hand,🔽 And menaced by a swordsman saying,🔽 “Spill one drop and you shall die!”🔽
2️⃣ This is how practitioners should hold themselves.🔽
Just as a man would swiftly stand🔽 If in his lap a serpent were to glide,🔽 If sleep and lethargy beset me,🔽 I will speedily repulse them.🔽
Every time, then, that I fail,🔽 I will reprove and chide myself,🔽 Thinking long that by whatever means🔽 Such faults in future shall no more occur.🔽
At all times and in any situation,🔽 How can I make mindfulness my constant habit?🔽
1️⃣ Thinking thus I will desire🔽 To meet with teachers and fulfill the proper tasks.🔽
1️⃣ By all means, then, before I start some work,🔽 That I might have the strength sufficient to the task,🔽 I will recall the teachings upon carefulness🔽 And lightly rise to what is to be done.🔽
Just as flaxen threads waft to and fro,🔽 Impelled by every breath of wind,🔽 So all I do will be achieved,🔽 Controlled by movements of a joyful heart.🔽
🔽
1️⃣ 8 Meditative Concentration🔽
Cultivating diligence as just described,🔽 In concentration I will place my mind.🔽
1️⃣ For those whose minds are slack and wandering🔽 Are caught between the fangs of the afflictions.🔽
In solitude, the mind and body🔽 Are not troubled by distraction.🔽
Therefore leave this worldly life🔽 And totally abandon mental wandering.🔽
Because of loved ones and desire for gain,🔽 We fail to turn away from worldly things.🔽
2️⃣ These, then, are the first things to renounce.🔽
1️⃣ The prudent should conduct themselves like this.🔽
Penetrative insight joined with calm abiding🔽 Utterly eradicates afflicted states.🔽
1️⃣ Knowing this, first search for calm abiding,🔽 Found by people who are happy to be free from worldly ties.🔽
Beings, brief, ephemeral,🔽 Who strongly cling to what is also transient,🔽 Will catch no glimpse of those they love🔽 For many thousands of their future lives.🔽
Not seeing them, their minds will have no joy,🔽 They therefore will not rest in equanimity.🔽
But even if they see them, they are not content—🔽 And as before, the pain of longing stays.🔽
1️⃣ If I crave for other beings,🔽 A veil is cast upon the perfect truth.🔽
1️⃣ Wholesome disillusion melts away,🔽 And finally there comes the sting of pain.🔽
My thoughts are all for them,🔽 And thus my life is frittered by.🔽
2️⃣ My family and friends all change and pass, for whom🔽 The changeless Dharma is cast out.🔽
For if I act like childish beings,🔽 Sure it is that I shall fall to evil destinies.🔽
1️⃣ So why do I keep company with infants,🔽 Who lead me to a state so far from virtue?🔽
One moment friends,🔽 The next, they’re bitter enemies.🔽
1️⃣ Even pleasant things arouse their discontent:🔽 Ordinary people—it is hard to please them!🔽
A beneficial word and they resent it,🔽 Turning me instead from what is good.🔽
1️⃣ And when I close my ears to what they say,🔽 Their anger makes them fall to lower states.🔽
Jealous of superiors, they vie with equals,🔽 Proud to those below, they strut when praised.🔽
Say something untoward, they seethe with rage.🔽
1️⃣ What good was ever had from childish folk?🔽
2️⃣ Keep company with them and what will follow?🔽
1️⃣ Self-aggrandizement and scorn for others,🔽 Talk about the “good things” of saṃsāra—🔽 Every kind of vice is sure to come.🔽
Only ruin can result🔽 From such a link between myself and others.🔽
1️⃣ For they will bring no benefit to me,🔽 And I in turn can do them nothing good.🔽
Therefore flee the company of childish people.🔽
1️⃣ Greet them, when you meet, with smiles🔽 That keep on terms of common courtesy,🔽 Without inviting intimate relations.🔽
Like bees that get their honey from the flowers,🔽 Take only what will serve the practice of the Dharma.🔽
2️⃣ Treat everyone like new acquaintances🔽 And keep yourself from close familiarity.🔽 
“Oh I am rich and well respected;🔽 Lots of people take delight in me.”🔽
1️⃣ Nourish such complacency and later,🔽 After death, your fears will start!🔽
Indeed, O foolish and afflicted mind,🔽 You want and crave for all and everything.🔽
1️⃣ All this together will rise up🔽 As pain itself, increased a thousandfold.🔽
Since this is so, the wise have no attachments;🔽 From such cravings fear and anguish come.🔽
2️⃣ And fix this firmly in your understanding:🔽 All that may be wished for will by nature fade to nothing.🔽
For people may have gained great wealth of riches,🔽 Enjoying reputation, sweet renown.🔽
2️⃣ But who can say where they have gone to now,🔽 With all the baggage of their gold and fame?🔽
Why should I be pleased when people praise me?🔽Others there will be who scorn and criticize—🔽 
And why despondent when I’m blamed,🔽 Since there’ll be others who think well of me?🔽2️⃣ So many are the leanings and the wants of beings🔽 That even Buddha could not please them all—🔽 
Of such a wretch as me no need to speak!🔽
1️⃣ I’ll give up such concerns with worldly things.🔽
People scorn the poor who have no wealth,🔽 They also criticize the rich who have it.🔽
1️⃣ What pleasure can derive from keeping company🔽 With people such as these, so difficult to please?🔽
1️⃣ In kindness childish beings take no delight🔽 Unless their own desires are satisfied.🔽
1️⃣ A childish person, thus, is no true friend.🔽
1️⃣ This the Tathāgatas have declared.🔽
In woodlands, haunt of stag and bird,🔽 Among the trees where no dissension jars,🔽 It’s there I would keep pleasant company!🔽
1️⃣ When might I be off to make my dwelling there?🔽
When shall I depart to make my home🔽 In cave or empty shrine or under spreading tree,🔽 With, in my breast, a free, unfettered heart,🔽 Which never turns to cast a backward glance?🔽
When might I abide in such a place,🔽 A place unclaimed and ownerless,🔽 That’s wide and unconfined, a place where I might stay🔽 At liberty, without attachment?🔽
When might I be free of fear,🔽 Without the need to hide from anyone,🔽 With just a begging bowl and few belongings,🔽 Dressed in garments coveted by none?🔽
And going to the charnel ground,🔽 When shall I compare🔽 My body with the dry bones there,🔽 So soon to fall to nothing, all alike?🔽
This form of mine, this very flesh🔽 Is soon to give out such a stench🔽 That even jackals won’t come close—🔽 And that indeed is all it will become.🔽
This body, now so whole and integral,🔽 This flesh and bone that life has knit together,🔽 Will drift apart, disintegrate,🔽 And how much more will friend depart from friend?🔽
Alone we’re born, alone we come into the world,🔽 And when we die, alone we pass away.🔽
1️⃣ No one shares our fate, and none our suffering.🔽
What need have I of “friends” who hinder me?🔽
Like those who journey on the road,🔽 Who pause and lodge along the way,🔽 Beings on the pathways of existence🔽 Seize upon the lodging of their birth.🔽
Until the time comes round🔽 When four men carry me away,🔽 Amid the grief of worldly folk—🔽 Till then, I will away and go into the forest.🔽
There, with no befriending or begrudging,🔽 I will stay alone in solitude,🔽 Considered from the outset as already dead,🔽 Thus, when I die, a source of pain to none.🔽
🔽2️⃣ Then there will be no one standing by🔽 In tears and mourning, thus to trouble me.🔽
1️⃣ And no one will be there distracting me🔽 From thinking of the Buddha and the practice.🔽
Therefore in these lovely gleaming woods,🔽 With joy that’s marred by few concerns,🔽 Where mental wandering will cease,🔽 I will remain in blissful solitude.🔽
Relinquishing all other aspirations,🔽 Focusing myself on one intent alone,🔽 I’ll strive to still my mind🔽 And, calming it, to bring it to subjection.🔽
In this and in the worlds to come,🔽 Desire’s the parent of all woe:🔽 In this world, killing, bonds, and wounds,🔽 And in the next, the hells and other pains.🔽
You send your go-betweens, both boy and maid,🔽 With many invitations for the prize,🔽 Avoiding, in the quest, no sin,🔽 No deed that brings an ill renown,🔽 Nor acts of frightful risk,🔽 Nor loss and ruin of possessions—🔽 
All for pleasure and the perfect bliss,🔽 That utmost penetrating kiss🔽 Of what in truth is nothing but a heap of bones🔽 Devoid of self, without autonomy!🔽2️⃣ Is this the only object of desire and lust?🔽
2️⃣ Sooner pass beyond all suffering and grief!🔽
What pains you went to just to lift her face,🔽 Her face that modestly looked down,🔽 Which, looked upon or not before,🔽 Was always with a veil concealed.🔽
That face for which you languished so 🔽Well, here it is, now nakedly exposed.🔽
1️⃣ The vultures have uncovered it for you to see.🔽
1️⃣ What’s this? You run away so soon?🔽
That which once you jealously protected,🔽 Shielded from the eyes of other men,🔽 Why, miser that you are, don’t you protect it,🔽 Now that it’s the food of graveyard birds?🔽
Look, this mass of human flesh,🔽 Is now the fare of carrion beasts—🔽 And you would deck with garlands, sandalwood, and jewels,🔽 The food and provender of others?🔽
Look again, this heap of bones—🔽 Inert and dead.
2️⃣ Why, what are you so scared of?🔽
1️⃣ Why did you not fear it when it walked around,🔽 Just like a risen corpse propelled by some strange influence?🔽
2️⃣ You loved it once, when clothed and draped it was.🔽
1️⃣ Well, now it’s naked, why do you not want it?🔽
1️⃣ Ah, you say, your need is no more there,🔽 But why did you embrace it, all bedecked and covered?🔽
From food, a single source, come equally🔽 The body’s filth and nectar of the mouth.🔽
So why are you delighted by saliva,🔽 And yet repelled by excrement?🔽
Taking no delight in pillows🔽 Made of cotton soft to touch,🔽 You claim the human form emits no stench.🔽
1️⃣ Befooled by lust, its filth you do not recognize!🔽
Lustful one, befuddled by desire,🔽 Because you cannot copulate with it,🔽 You angrily find fault with cotton,🔽 Soft though it may be to touch!🔽
And if you have no love of filth,🔽 How can you coddle on your lap🔽 A cage of bones tied fast with sinews,🔽 Plastered over with the mud of flesh?🔽
In fact you’re full of filth yourself;🔽 You wallow in it constantly.🔽
1️⃣ It is indeed just filth that you desire,🔽 And therefore long for other sacks of it!🔽 
“1️⃣ But it’s the skin and flesh I love🔽 To touch and look upon.”🔽
1️⃣ Then why do you not wish for flesh alone,🔽 Inanimate and in its natural state?🔽
The mind that you perhaps desire,🔽 You cannot hold or look upon.🔽
1️⃣ Whatever you can hold or see is not the mind—🔽 Why copulate with something it is not?🔽
1️⃣ To fail to grasp the unclean nature🔽 Of another’s flesh is not perhaps so strange.🔽
1️⃣ But not to see the filthy nature🔽 Of oneself is very strange indeed!🔽
Why does the mind, intent on filthiness,🔽 Neglect the fresh young lotus blossom,🔽 Opened in the sunlight of a cloudless sky,🔽 To take joy rather in a sack of dirt?🔽
And since you’re disinclined to touch🔽 A place or object grimed with excrement,🔽 Why do you wish to touch the body🔽 Whence such excrement has come?🔽
And if you have no craving for impurity,🔽 Why will you now embrace and kiss🔽 What comes from such an unclean place,🔽 Engendered likewise from an unclean seed?🔽
The tiny fetid worms that come from filth—🔽 You have no love of them.🔽
1️⃣ And yet you’re lusting for a human form,🔽 From filth arisen and replete with it.🔽
Toward your own impurity🔽 Disgust you do not feel;🔽 And yearning and athirst for filth,🔽 You long for other sacks of it!🔽
Pleasant substances like camphor,🔽 Rice, and fresh green herbs—🔽 Put them in your mouth and spit them out:🔽 The earth itself is fouled thereby!🔽
1️⃣ If still you doubt such filthiness,🔽 Though it is very plain for all to see,🔽 Go off into the charnel grounds;🔽 Observe the fetid bodies there abandoned.🔽
When their skins are peeled away,🔽 You feel great horror and revulsion.🔽
1️⃣ Now that you have understood,🔽 How can you still take joy in such a thing?🔽
The scent that now perfumes the skin🔽 Is sandalwood and nothing else.🔽
1️⃣ Yet how is it that one thing’s fragrance🔽 Causes you to long for something else?🔽
Is it not best to have no lust🔽 For something that by nature stinks?🔽
1️⃣ The worldly crave beside their purpose—🔽 Why do they anoint their flesh with pleasant scents?🔽
For if this scent is sandalwood,🔽 How can it be the perfume of the body?🔽
1️⃣ How is it that the fragrance of a thing🔽 Induces you to crave for something else?🔽
With lanky hair, with long nails overgrown,🔽 With dirty teeth all reeking with the stink of slime,🔽 This body, naked, as it is, untended—🔽 Is indeed a horror to behold!🔽
Why go to such excess to clean and polish🔽 What is but a weapon that will injure you?🔽
1️⃣ The cares that people squander on themselves in ignorance🔽 Convulse the universe with madness.🔽
When you saw the heaps of human bones,🔽 You felt revulsion in the charnel ground.🔽
1️⃣ And will you take delight in cities of the dead🔽 Frequented by such skeletons that live and move?🔽
2️⃣ What’s more, possession of another’s filth🔽 Is not to be acquired free of charge.🔽
2️⃣ All is at a price: exhaustion in this life,🔽 And in the next, the suffering of hell!🔽
To gather riches young boys are unable,🔽 And what can they enjoy when they’re full grown?🔽
1️⃣ The whole of life is spent in gaining wealth,🔽 But then they’re old—too old to satisfy their lust!🔽
Some are wretched in their great desire,🔽 But worn out by their daylong work,🔽 They go home broken by fatigue🔽 To sleep the slumbers of a corpse.🔽
Some, wearied by their travels far from home,🔽 Must suffer separation from their wives🔽 And children whom they love and long to see.🔽
2️⃣ They do not meet with them for years on end.🔽
Some, ambitious for prosperity,🔽 Not knowing how to get it, sell themselves.🔽
3️⃣ Happiness eludes their grasp and pointlessly🔽 They live and labor for their masters.🔽
Some sell themselves, no longer free,🔽 In bondage, slavery to others.🔽
1️⃣ And, destitute, their wives give birth🔽 With only trees for shelter, in the wild.🔽
Fools deceived by craving for a livelihood🔽 Decide that they will make their fortune🔽 In the wars, though fearful for their lives.🔽
1️⃣ And seeking gain, it’s slavery they get.🔽
Some, as the result of craving,🔽 Have their bodies slashed, impaled on pointed stakes.🔽
1️⃣ Some are wounded, run through by the lance,🔽 While some are put to death by fire.🔽
The pain of gaining, keeping, and of losing all!🔽
1️⃣ See the endless hardships brought on us by property!🔽
For those distracted by their love of wealth🔽 There is no chance for freedom from the sorrows of existence.🔽
1️⃣ They indeed, possessed of many wants,🔽 Will suffer many troubles, all for very little:🔽 They’re like the ox that pulls the cart🔽 And catches bits of grass along the way.🔽
For sake of such a paltry thing,🔽 Which is not rare, which even beasts can find,🔽 Tormented by their karma, they destroy🔽 This precious human life so hard to find.🔽
All that we desire is sure to perish,🔽 On which account we fall to hellish pain.🔽
2️⃣ For what amounts to very little🔽 We must suffer constant and exhausting weariness.🔽
With but a millionth part of such vexation🔽 Enlightenment itself could be attained!🔽
2️⃣ Those who crave are plagued far more than those engaged upon the path,🔽 Yet Buddhahood is not what they attain!🔽
Reflect upon the pains of hell and other evil states!🔽
Weapons, fires, and poisons,🔽 Yawning chasms, hostile foes—🔽 None is on a level with our cravings.🔽
So, revolted by our lust and wanting,🔽 Let us now rejoice in solitude,🔽 In places empty of all conflict and defilement:🔽 The peace and stillness of the forest.🔽
Happy those intent on others’ good,🔽 Who roam in pleasant places formed of massive stone,🔽 Refreshed by moonlight’s sandal-scented beams,🔽 By gentle woodland breezes soothed!🔽
In caves, beneath the trees, in houses left abandoned,🔽 May we linger long as we might wish.🔽
1️⃣ Relinquishing the pain of guarding our possessions,🔽 Let us live in freedom, unconfined by cares.🔽
To have such liberty unmarred by craving,🔽 Loosed from every bond and tie—🔽 A life of such contentment and such pleasure,🔽 Even Indra would be pressed to find!🔽
1️⃣ Reflecting in such ways as these🔽 Upon the excellence of solitude,🔽 Pacify completely all discursiveness🔽 
And cultivate the mind of bodhichitta.🔽 Strive at first to meditate🔽 Upon the sameness of yourself and others.🔽
In joy and sorrow all are equal;🔽 Thus be guardian of all, as of yourself.🔽
The hand and other limbs are many and distinct,🔽 But all are one—the body to be kept and guarded.🔽
Likewise, different beings, in their joys and sorrows,🔽 Are, like me, all one in wanting happiness.🔽
This pain of mine does not afflict🔽 Or cause discomfort to another’s body,🔽 And yet this pain is hard for me to bear🔽 Because I cling and take it for my own.🔽
And other beings’ pain🔽 I do not feel, and yet,🔽 Because I take them for myself,🔽 Their suffering is mine and therefore hard to bear.🔽
And therefore I’ll dispel the pain of others,🔽 For it is simply pain, just like my own.🔽
And others I will aid and benefit,🔽 For they are living beings, like my body.🔽
Since I and other beings both,🔽 In wanting happiness, are equal and alike,🔽 What difference is there to distinguish us,🔽 That I should strive to have my bliss alone?🔽
Since I and other beings both,🔽 In fleeing suffering, are equal and alike,🔽 What difference is there to distinguish us,🔽 That I should save myself and not the others?🔽
Since the pain of others does no harm to me,🔽 I do not shield myself from it.🔽
1️⃣ So why to guard against “my” future pain,🔽 Which does no harm to this, my present “me”?🔽
To think that “I will have to bear it”🔽 Is in fact a false idea.🔽
1️⃣ For that which dies is one thing;🔽 What is born is something else.🔽 
“ It’s for the sufferers themselves,” you’ll say,🔽 “To shield themselves from injuries that come!”🔽
The pain felt in my foot is not my hand’s,🔽 So why, in fact, should one protect the other?🔽 
“True, it’s inadmissible,” you’ll say,🔽 “It happens simply through the force of ego-clinging.”🔽
1️⃣ But what is inadmissible for others and myself🔽 Should be discarded utterly!🔽
Continua and gatherings, so-called,🔽 Like garlands and like armies, are unreal.🔽
So there is no one to experience pain🔽 For who is there to be its “owner”?🔽
Suffering has no “possessor,”🔽 Therefore no distinctions can be made in it.🔽
Since pain is pain, it is to be dispelled.🔽
1️⃣ What use is there in drawing boundaries?🔽 
“ But why dispel the pains of all?”🔽
1️⃣ You cannot argue in this way!🔽
2️⃣ If “my” pain is removed, so too should that of “others.”🔽
2️⃣ If theirs is not, then neither should be mine.🔽 
“Compassion makes us feel such pain,” you say,🔽 “So why should we make efforts to engender it?”🔽
But thinking of the sufferings of beings,🔽 How can you regard as great the smart of your compassion?🔽
And if through such a single pain🔽 A multitude of sorrows can be cured,🔽 Such pain as this all loving people🔽 Strive to foster in themselves and others.🔽
Thus Supuṣhpachandra,🔽 Knowing that the king would cause him harm,🔽 Did nothing to escape from tribulation,🔽 That the pains of many should be ended.🔽
Those whose minds are practiced in this way,🔽 Whose joy it is to soothe another’s ills,🔽 Will venture into hell of Unrelenting Pain🔽 As swans sweep down upon a lotus lake.🔽
1️⃣ The ocean-like immensity of joy🔽 Arising when all beings will be freed,🔽 Will this not be enough?
Will this not satisfy?🔽
1️⃣ The wish for my own freedom, what is that to me?🔽
2️⃣ The work of bringing benefit to beings🔽 Will not, then, make me proud and self-admiring.🔽
1️⃣ The happiness of others is itself my satisfaction;🔽 I do not expect another recompense.🔽
Therefore just as I defend myself🔽 From even slight disparagement,🔽 In just the same way with regard to others,🔽 I should likewise have a mind protective and compassionate.🔽
The drop of sperm and blood belonged to others.🔽
1️⃣ Yet, through strong habituation,🔽 I came to have in its regard a sense of “I,”🔽 Though, in itself, it is devoid of entity.🔽
And so, why not identify🔽 Another’s body, calling it my “I”?🔽
1️⃣ And vice versa, why should it be hard🔽 To think of this my body as another’s?🔽
Perceiving now the faults possessed by “I,”🔽 The ocean of good qualities that are in “other,”🔽 I shall lay aside all love of self🔽 And gain the habit of adopting other beings.🔽
Just as hands and other limbs🔽 Are thought of as the members of a body,🔽 Can we likewise not consider others🔽 As the limbs and members of a living whole?🔽
Just as in connection with this form, devoid of self,🔽 My sense of “I” arose through strong habituation,🔽 Why should not the thought of “I,”🔽 Through habit, not arise related to another?🔽
Thus when I work for others’ sake,🔽 There’ll be no sense of boasting self-congratulation.🔽
1️⃣ It is just as when I feed myself—🔽 I don’t expect to be rewarded!🔽
Therefore just as I defend myself🔽 From even slight disparagement,🔽 Likewise for beings I shall now grow used🔽 To have a mind protective and compassionate.🔽
This is why the Lord Avalokita🔽 Out of great compassion blessed his name,🔽 That those caught in the midst of multitudes🔽 Might be released and freed from every fear.🔽
And so we should be undeterred by hardships,🔽 For through the influence of use and habit,🔽 People even come to grieve🔽 For those whose very names struck terror in their hearts!🔽
1️⃣ Those desiring speedily to be🔽 A refuge for themselves and others🔽 Should make the interchange of “I” and “other,”🔽 And thus embrace a sacred mystery.🔽
Because of our attachment to our bodies,🔽 Even little things alarm us.🔽
This body, then, this source of so much terror—🔽 Who would not detest it as the worst of foes?🔽
Wishing to relieve our bodies’ ills,🔽 Our hungry mouths, the dryness of our throats,🔽 We steal the lives of fishes, birds, and deer🔽 And lie in wait along the road.🔽
And for the sake of profit and position🔽 Some there are who even kill their parents,🔽 Or steal what has been offered to the Triple Gem,🔽 Because of which, they’ll burn in hell of Unrelenting Pain.🔽
Where are the wise and prudent then🔽 Who cherish, guard, and serve the body?🔽
1️⃣ Who would not perceive it as their foe,🔽 And as their foe, regard it with contempt?🔽 
“If I give this, what will be left for me?”🔽
1️⃣ Thinking of oneself—the way of evil ghosts.🔽 
“1️⃣ If I keep this, what will be left to give?”🔽
2️⃣ Concern for others is the way of heaven.🔽
If to serve myself I harm another,🔽 I’ll suffer later in the realms of hell.🔽
But if for others’ sake I harm myself,🔽 Then every excellence will be my heritage.🔽
Wanting what is best for me—🔽 Stupidity, inferiority, and lower realms result!🔽
1️⃣ Let this be changed, applied to others—🔽 Honors and the realms of bliss will come!🔽
Enslaving others, forcing them to serve me,🔽 I will come to know the state of servitude.🔽
1️⃣ But if I labor for the good of others,🔽 Mastery and leadership will come to me.🔽
All the joy the world contains🔽 Has come through wishing happiness for others.🔽
All the misery the world contains🔽 Has come through wanting pleasure for oneself.🔽
Is there need for lengthy explanation?🔽
1️⃣ Childish beings look out for themselves;🔽 Buddhas labor for the good of others:🔽 See the difference that divides them!🔽
If I do not interchange🔽 My happiness for others’ pain,🔽 Enlightenment will never be attained,🔽 And even in saṃsāra, joy will fly from me.🔽
Leaving future lives outside the reckoning,🔽 Even this life’s needs are not fulfilled:🔽 The servants do not do their work,🔽 And masters do not pay the wages earned.🔽
Casting far away abundant joys🔽 That may be gained in this or future lives,🔽
Because of bringing harm to other beings,🔽 I ignorantly bring myself intolerable pain.🔽
All the harm with which this world is rife,🔽 All fear and suffering that there is,🔽 Clinging to the “I” has caused it!🔽
What am I to do with this great demon?🔽
If this “I” is not relinquished wholly,🔽 Sorrow likewise cannot be avoided.🔽
If they do not keep away from fire,🔽 People can’t escape from being burned.🔽
To free myself from harm🔽 And others from their sufferings,🔽 Let me give myself to others,🔽 Loving them as I now love myself.🔽 “
For I am now beneath the rule of others,”🔽 Of this you must be certain, O my mind.🔽
1️⃣ And now no longer shall you have a thought🔽 That does not wish the benefit of beings.🔽
My sight and other senses, now the property of others—🔽 To use them for myself would be improper.🔽
2️⃣ And it is likewise disallowed🔽 To use my faculties against their owners!🔽
Thus sentient beings will be my chief concern.🔽
1️⃣ And everything I see my body has🔽 Will all be seized and offered🔽 For the use and service of all other beings.🔽
Take others—lower, higher, equal—as yourself,🔽 Identify yourself as “other.”🔽
Then, without another thought,🔽 Immerse yourself in envy, pride, and rivalry.🔽
I am nothing.🔽
2️⃣ And, unlike him, I’m poor without possessions.🔽
1️⃣ Everyone looks up to him, despising me,🔽 All goes well for him; for me there’s only bitterness!🔽
2️⃣ All I have is sweat and drudgery,🔽 While he’s there, sitting at his ease.🔽
He’s great, respected in the world,🔽 While I’m the underdog, a well-known nobody.🔽
What! A nobody without distinction?🔽
1️⃣ I do have some good qualities.🔽
1️⃣ Compared with some, he’s lower down.🔽
1️⃣ Compared with some, I do excel!🔽
My discipline, my understanding have declined,🔽 But I am helpless, ruled by my defilements.🔽
1️⃣ As much as he is able, he should cure me.🔽
1️⃣ I will be submissive even to his punishments.🔽
2️⃣ The fact is he does nothing of the sort!🔽
1️⃣ By what right, then, does he belittle me?🔽
1️⃣ What use, then, are his qualities to me—🔽 Those qualities of which he’s so possessed?🔽
Indifferent to the plight of living beings,🔽 Who tread the brink of evil destinies,🔽 He makes an outward show of virtues,🔽 And even wants to vie with sages.🔽
2️⃣ That I might excel, outstripping him—🔽 Him, regarded as my peer and equal!🔽
1️⃣ In contests I will certainly secure🔽 My fame and fortune, public renown.🔽
By every means I’ll advertise🔽 My gifts to all the world,🔽 Ensuring that his qualities🔽 Remain unknown, ignored by everyone.🔽
My faults I will conceal, dissimulate.🔽
1️⃣ For I, not he, will be the object of devotion;🔽 I, not he, will gain possessions and renown,🔽 I will be the center of attention.🔽
2️⃣ I will take such satisfaction🔽 In his evil deeds and degradation.🔽
1️⃣ I will render him despicable,🔽 The butt and laughingstock of everyone.🔽
2️⃣ People say this pitiful nonentity🔽 Is trying to compete with me!🔽
1️⃣ But how can he be on a par With me,🔽 in learning, beauty, wealth, or pedigree?🔽
Just to hear them talk about my excellence,🔽 My reputation on the lips of all,🔽 The thrill of it sends shivers down my spine,🔽 A pleasure that I bask and revel in!🔽
1️⃣ Even if he does have something,🔽 I’m the one he’s working for!🔽
1️⃣ He can keep enough just to survive,🔽 But with my strength I’ll steal the rest away.🔽
I will wear his happiness away;🔽 I will always hurt and injure him.🔽
1️⃣ He’s the one who in saṃsāra🔽 Did me mischiefs by the hundred!🔽
Countless ages, O my mind,🔽 You spent, desiring to attain your aims.🔽
1️⃣ And what great weariness it was,🔽 While your reward was only misery!🔽
And therefore now most certainly🔽 Apply yourself completely to the good of others.🔽
1️⃣ The Buddha did not lie in what he said—🔽 You’ll see the benefits that come from it.🔽
If indeed, you had in former times🔽 Embraced this work and undertaken it,🔽 You could not still be lacking🔽 In the perfect bliss of Buddhahood.🔽
Therefore, just as you identify🔽 A drop of others’ blood and sperm,🔽 And cling to it as though it were yourself,🔽 Now take sentient beings—others—as your self.🔽
2️⃣ Now for others you should spy🔽 On everything your body seems to have.🔽
1️⃣ Steal it, take it all away,🔽 And use it for the benefit of others.🔽
I indeed am happy, others sad;🔽 I am high and mighty, others low;🔽 I am helped while others are abandoned:🔽 Why am I not jealous of myself?🔽
Happiness, fulfillment: these I give away.🔽
1️⃣ The pain of others: this I will embrace.🔽
1️⃣ Inquiring of myself repeatedly🔽 I will thus investigate my faults.🔽
When others are at fault, I’ll take🔽 And turn the blame upon myself,🔽 And all my sins, however slight,🔽 Declare, and make them known to many.🔽 
The fame of others I will magnify🔽 That it might thus outshine my own.🔽
1️⃣ Among them I will be as one who serves,🔽 My lowly labor for their benefit.🔽
This ego is by nature rife with faults,🔽 Its accidental gifts I should not praise.🔽
1️⃣ Whatever qualities it has I’ll so contrive🔽 That they remain unknown to everyone.🔽
All the harm, in short, that ego does🔽 To its advantage and to others’ cost,🔽 May all of it descend upon itself,🔽 To its own hurt—to others’ benefit.🔽
Do not let it strut about the place,🔽 So arrogant, so overbearing.🔽
2️⃣ But like a newly wedded bride,🔽 
Let it be demure and blushing, timorous and shy!🔽 
“2️⃣ Do this!” “1️⃣ Be like that!” 
“1️⃣ Such things don’t ever do!”🔽
1️⃣ It’s thus that you will bring it forcibly to heel.🔽
1️⃣ And if it oversteps the mark,🔽 Well then, apply the lash!🔽
And so, O mind, if still you will refuse,🔽 Though you have been so lengthily advised,🔽 Since every evil has its roots in you,🔽 You are indeed now ripe for punishment!🔽
The time when you could do me harm🔽 Is in the past and now is here no more.🔽
Now I see you! Where will you escape?🔽
1️⃣ I’ll bring you down with all your haughty insolence.🔽
Let every thought of working for yourself🔽 Be utterly rejected, cast aside!🔽
1️⃣ Now that you’ve been sold to others,🔽 Stop your whining, be of service!🔽
For if, through being inattentive,🔽 I do not deliver you to others,🔽 You will hand me over, it is certain,🔽 To the guards and janitors of hell.🔽
For this is how so many times🔽 You have betrayed me, and how long I’ve suffered!🔽
1️⃣ Now my memory is full of rancor,🔽 I will crush your selfish schemes!🔽
And so it is that if I want contentment,🔽 I should never seek to please myself.🔽
And likewise, if I wish to guard myself,🔽 Of others I should always be the guard.🔽
To the extent this human form🔽 Is cosseted and saved from hurt,🔽 Just so, just so, to that degree,🔽 It dwindles to a weak and fretful state.🔽
For those who sink to such a pass,🔽 The earth and all it holds🔽 Are powerless to satisfy.🔽
1️⃣ For who can give them all they crave?🔽
1️⃣ Their hopeless craving brings them misery,🔽 And evil schemes invade their minds,🔽 While those with free, untrammeled hearts,🔽 Will never know an end of excellence.🔽
Therefore for the increase of my body’s wants,🔽 I’ll give no space, no opportunity.🔽
1️⃣ And of possessions, those things are the best🔽 That do not captivate by their attractiveness.🔽
🔽2️⃣ Dust and ashes are the body’s final state—🔽 This body which, inert, is moved by other forces.🔽
1️⃣ This form so frightening and foul—🔽 Why do I so regard it as my “self”?🔽
Alive or dead what difference does it make?🔽
1️⃣ What use is this machine to me?🔽
1️⃣ What difference will divide it from a clod of earth?🔽
1️⃣ Alas that I don’t rid myself of pride!🔽
1️⃣ Through lavishing attention on this body,🔽 Such sorrow have I brought myself so senselessly.🔽
1️⃣ What use is all my wanting, all my hating,🔽 For what indeed is like a log of wood?🔽
Whether I protect and pamper it,🔽 Or whether it is eaten up by carrion birds,🔽 This body feels no pleasure, no aversion.🔽
1️⃣ Why then do I cherish it so much?🔽
2️⃣ Resentment when it is reviled,🔽 Or pleasure when it is esteemed,🔽 Neither of these two my body feels.🔽
1️⃣ So why do I exhaust myself?🔽
If I say I do it since it’s loved by other people,🔽 Others whom I thus regard as friends,🔽 Since all appreciate the bodies that they have,🔽 Why do I not take pleasure in them too?🔽
Therefore, free from all attachment,🔽 I will give this body for the benefit of beings.🔽
1️⃣ And though it is afflicted by so many faults,🔽 I shall adopt it as my necessary tool.🔽
And so, enough of all my childish ways.🔽
1️⃣ I’ll follow in the footsteps of the wise;🔽 Recalling their advice on carefulness,🔽 I’ll shun all sleep and mental dullness.🔽
Like the Buddhas’ heirs, in their compassion,🔽 I will bear with all that should be borne.🔽
For if I do not labor night and day,🔽 When will my sorrows reach their end?🔽
Thus to banish all obscuring veils🔽 I’ll bend my mind from the mistaken path;🔽 And constantly upon the perfect object🔽 I shall rest my mind in even meditation.🔽

🔽
1️⃣ 9 Wisdom🔽 
All these branches of the Doctrine🔽 The Enlightened Sage expounded for the sake of wisdom.🔽
1️⃣ Therefore they must cultivate this wisdom🔽 Who wish to have an end of suffering.🔽
Relative and ultimate,🔽 These the two truths are declared to be.🔽
1️⃣ The ultimate is not within the reach of intellect,🔽 For intellect is said to be the relative.🔽
In light of this, within the world, two kinds of people are observed:🔽 Those with yogic insight and the common run of people.🔽
1️⃣ In this regard, the views of ordinary folk🔽 Are undermined by yogis who themselves are in the world🔽 (Within whose ranks🔽 The lower, in degrees of insight, are confuted by the higher)🔽 By means of the examples that the yogis and the worldly both accept.🔽
1️⃣ And for the sake of the result, analysis is left aside.🔽
When ordinary folk perceive phenomena,🔽 They look on them as real, and not illusory.🔽
1️⃣ This, then, is the subject of debate🔽 Where ordinary and yogis differ.🔽
Forms and so forth, which we all perceive,🔽 Exist by general acclaim but not by valid reasoning.🔽
1️⃣ They’re false just like, for instance, unclean things🔽 Regarded in the common view as pure.🔽
But that he might instruct the worldly,🔽 Our Protector spoke of “things.”🔽
1️⃣ But these in truth lack even momentariness.🔽
2️⃣ Now if you say it’s wrong to claim the momentary as relative,🔽 There is no fault.
2️⃣ For momentariness🔽 Is relative for yogis, but for worldly beings, ultimate.🔽
2️⃣ Were it otherwise, the common view🔽 Could fault the yogic insight into corporal impurity.🔽 
“2️⃣ Through a Buddha, who is but illusion, how does merit spring?”🔽
2️⃣ As if the Buddha were existing truly.🔽 
“But,” you ask, “if beings are like illusions,🔽 How, when dying, can they take rebirth?”🔽
As long as the conditions are assembled,🔽 Illusions, likewise, will persist and manifest.🔽
1️⃣ Why, through simply being more protracted,🔽 Should sentient beings be regarded as more real?🔽
If one kills or harms the magical illusion of a man,🔽 There is no mind in such a thing and therefore there’s no sin.🔽
1️⃣ But beings do indeed have mirage-like minds;🔽 Sin and merit will, in consequence, arise.🔽
There is no power in things like spells,🔽 So mirage-like minds do not occur through them.🔽
1️⃣ Illusions spring from various causes;🔽 Thus illusions are of different kinds.🔽
A single cause for everything🔽 There never was!🔽 
“1️⃣ If ultimately, beings are in nirvāṇa,” you will say,🔽 “But relatively circle in saṃsāra,🔽 “Even Buddhahood reverts to the saṃsāric state.🔽
1️⃣ So why,” you ask, “pursue the Bodhisattva path?”🔽
1️⃣ As long as there’s no cutting of the causal stream,🔽 There is no halting even of illusory displays.🔽
But when the causal stream is severed,🔽 Even relative phenomena do not appear.🔽 
“1️⃣ If even that which is deceived does not exist,🔽 What is it,” you will ask, “that sees illusion?”🔽
But if, for you, these same illusions have no being,🔽 What, indeed, is there to be perceived?🔽 
“1️⃣ But objects have another mode of being,” you will say,🔽 “That very mode is but the mind itself.”🔽
But if the mirage is the mind itself,🔽 What is then perceived by what?🔽
The Guardian of the World himself has said🔽 That mind cannot be seen by mind.🔽
In just the same way, he has said,🔽 The sword’s edge cannot cut the sword.🔽 
“1️⃣ But,” you say, “it’s like the flame🔽 That perfectly illuminates itself.”🔽
1️⃣ The flame, in fact, can never light itself.🔽 And why?
1️⃣ Because the darkness never dims it!🔽 
“1️⃣ The blueness of a thing by nature blue,” you say,🔽 “Depends, unlike a crystal, upon nothing else.🔽 
“Likewise some perceptions🔽 Come from other things, while some do not.”🔽
1️⃣ But something that’s by nature blue has never of itself imposed🔽 A blueness on its non-blue self.🔽
The phrase “The lamp illuminates itself”🔽 The mind can know and formulate.🔽
1️⃣ But what is there to know and say🔽 That “mind is self-illuminating?”🔽
2️⃣ The mind, indeed, is never seen by anything.🔽
1️⃣ And therefore, whether it can know, or cannot know, itself,🔽 Is like the beauty of a barren woman’s daughter:🔽 Something that it’s pointless to discuss.🔽 
“But if,” you ask, “the mind is not self-knowing,🔽 How does it remember what it knew?”🔽
1️⃣ We say that, like the poison of the water rat,🔽 It’s through the link with things experienced that memory occurs.🔽 
“ In certain cases,” you will say,🔽 “the mind Can see the minds of others, how then not itself?”🔽
1️⃣ But through the application of a magic balm,🔽 The eye may see the treasure, but the salve it does not see.🔽
It’s not indeed our purpose to disprove🔽 Experiences of sight or sound or knowing.🔽
1️⃣ Our aim is here to undermine the cause of sorrow:🔽 The thought that such phenomena have true existence.🔽 
“Illusions are not other than the mind,” you say,🔽 And yet you don’t consider them the same.🔽
1️⃣ How could they not be different if the mind is real?🔽
1️⃣ And how can mind be real if you deny a difference?🔽
Although it is unreal, a mirage can be seen;🔽 And that which sees is just the same.🔽 
“But saṃsāra must be based on something real,” you say,🔽 “Or else it is like empty space.”🔽
But how could the unreal be causally effective,🔽 Even if it rests on something real?🔽
1️⃣ This mind of yours is isolated and alone,🔽 Alone, in solitude, and unaccompanied.🔽
If the mind indeed is free of objects,🔽 All beings must be Buddhas, Thus-Gone and enlightened.🔽
1️⃣ And so, what purpose can there be🔽 In saying thus, that there is “Only Mind”?🔽 
“Even if we know that all is like illusion,🔽 How,” you ask, “will this dispel afflictive passion?🔽
1️⃣ Magicians may indeed themselves desire🔽 The mirage-women they themselves create.”🔽
1️⃣ The reason is they have not rid themselves🔽 Of habits of desiring objects of perception;🔽 And when they gaze upon such things,🔽 Their aptitude for emptiness is weak indeed.🔽
By training in this aptitude for emptiness,🔽 The habit to perceive real things will be relinquished.🔽
1️⃣ By training in the thought “There isn’t anything,”🔽 This view itself will also be abandoned.🔽 
“ There is nothing”—when this is asserted,🔽 No thing is there to be examined.🔽
1️⃣ How can a “nothing,” wholly unsupported,🔽 Rest before the mind as something present?🔽
When something and its nonexistence🔽 Both are absent from before the mind,🔽 No other option does the latter have:🔽 It comes to perfect rest, from concepts free.🔽
As the wishing jewel and tree of miracles🔽 Fulfill and satisfy all hopes and wishes,🔽 Likewise, through their prayers for those who might be trained,🔽 The physical appearance of the Conquerors occurs.🔽
The healing shrine of the garuḍa,🔽 Even when its builder was long dead,🔽 Continued even ages thence🔽 To remedy and soothe all plagues and venom.🔽
Likewise having gained the “shrine of victory”🔽 In accordance with their deeds for sake of Buddhahood,🔽 Though Bodhisattvas pass beyond all grief,🔽 They yet can satisfy all ends.🔽 
“But how,” you ask, “can offerings made🔽 To beings freed from all discursiveness give fruit?”🔽
1️⃣ It’s said that whether Buddhas live or pass beyond,🔽 The offerings made to them are equal in their merit.🔽
Whether you assert them in the ultimate or relative,🔽 Merit, so the scriptures say, arises,🔽 Just as there will be results🔽 When Buddhas are considered truly real.🔽 
“ We’re free,” you say, “through seeing the (Four) Truths—🔽 What use is it to us, this view of emptiness?”🔽
But as the scriptures have themselves proclaimed,🔽 Without this path there can be no enlightenment.🔽
2️⃣ You say the Mahāyāna has no certainty.🔽
1️⃣ But how do you substantiate your own tradition?🔽 
“1️⃣ Because it is accepted by both parties,” you will say.🔽
1️⃣ But at the outset, you yourself lacked proof!🔽
The reasons why you trust in your tradition🔽 May likewise be applied to Mahāyāna.🔽
1️⃣ Moreover, if accord between two parties shows the truth,🔽 The Vedas and the rest are also true.🔽 
“1️⃣ Mahāyāna is at fault,” you say, “because it is contested.”🔽
1️⃣ But Buddhist texts are questioned by extremists,🔽 While Buddhists also vie among themselves;🔽 And so your own tradition you must now abandon.🔽
The true monk is the root of Dharma,🔽 And to be a monk is difficult indeed.🔽
1️⃣ It’s hard for minds enmeshed in thoughts🔽 To pass beyond the bonds of suffering.🔽
You say there’s liberation in the instant🔽 That defilements are entirely forsaken.🔽
1️⃣ Yet those who from defilements are set free🔽 Continue to display the influence of karma.🔽 
“ Only for a while,” you say. 🔽
“ For it is certain🔽 That the causes of rebirth, their cravings, are no more.”🔽
1️⃣ They have no craving, granted, through defilement,🔽 But like their ignorance, why should they not have craving undefiled?🔽
This craving is produced by virtue of sensation,🔽 And sensation, this they surely have.🔽
1️⃣ Concepts linger still within their minds;🔽 And it is to these concepts that they cling.🔽
The mind that has not realized voidness,🔽 May be halted, but will once again arise,🔽 Just as from a non-perceptual absorption.🔽
Therefore one must train in emptiness.🔽
If all the words recorded in the sūtras🔽 You admit to be the Buddha’s perfect speech,🔽 Why don’t you now accept the greater part of Mahāyāna,🔽 With which your sūtras are in perfect harmony?🔽
If due to just a single jarring element,🔽 The whole is held to be at fault,🔽 Why should a single sūtra in agreement with your texts🔽 Not vindicate the rest as Buddha’s teaching?🔽
Mahākāshyapa himself and others🔽 Could not sound the depths of such a teaching.🔽
1️⃣ Who will therefore say that they’re to be rejected🔽 Just because they are not grasped by you?🔽
To linger and abide within saṃsāra,🔽 Freed from every craving and from every fear,🔽 In order to achieve the good of those who ignorantly suffer:🔽 Such is the fruit that emptiness will bear.🔽
Therefore it is incorrect🔽 To find fault with this view of emptiness.🔽
1️⃣ And so, with every doubt abandoned,🔽 We should meditate on it!🔽
Afflictive passion and the veil upon cognition—🔽 The cure for their obscurity is emptiness.🔽
1️⃣ How then shall they not meditate on this🔽 Who wish for swift attainment of omniscience?🔽
1️⃣ Whatever is the source of suffering,🔽 Let that be the object of our fear.🔽
1️⃣ But voidness will allay our every grief,🔽 How could it be for us a thing of dread?🔽
If such a thing as “I” exists indeed,🔽 Then terrors, granted, will torment it.🔽
But since no self or “I” exists at all,🔽 What is there left for fears to terrify?🔽
The teeth, the hair, the nails are not the “I,”🔽 And “I” is not the bones or blood,🔽 The mucus from the nose and phlegm are not the “I,”🔽 And neither is it made of lymph or pus.🔽
The “I” is not the body’s grease or sweat,🔽 The lungs and liver likewise do not constitute it.🔽
1️⃣ Neither are the inner organs “I,”🔽 Nor yet the body’s excrement and waste.🔽
The flesh and skin are not the “I,”🔽 And neither are the body’s warmth and breath.🔽
1️⃣ The cavities within the frame are not the “I,”🔽 And “I” is not accounted for in sixfold consciousness.🔽
If the hearing consciousness is permanent,🔽 It follows that it’s hearing all the time.🔽
1️⃣ And if there is no object, what does it cognize?🔽
1️⃣ On what grounds do you call it consciousness?🔽
If something that’s unconscious knows,🔽 It follows that a stick has knowledge also.🔽
1️⃣ Therefore in the absence of a thing to know,🔽 It’s clear that consciousness will not arise.🔽
If the selfsame consciousness detects a form,🔽 At that time, why does it not hear?🔽
1️⃣ Perhaps you say the sound’s no longer there.🔽
1️⃣ Then neither is there consciousness of sound.🔽
How could that which has the nature of a sound-perceiver🔽 Ever be transformed into a form-perceiver?🔽 
“ A single man,” you say, “can be both son and father.”🔽
1️⃣ But these are merely names; his nature is not so.🔽
1️⃣ And likewise “pain,” “neutrality,” and “pleasure”🔽 Are neither fatherhood nor sonship;🔽 And we indeed have never yet observed🔽 A consciousness of form perceiving sound.🔽 
“ But like an actor,” you reply, “it takes a different role and sees.”🔽
1️⃣ If so, this consciousness is not a constant thing.🔽
1️⃣ And if its later mode is still the first,🔽 That’s identity indeed and never seen before!🔽 
“But its different modes,” you say, “are quite unreal.”🔽
2️⃣ Its essence therefore you must now describe.🔽
1️⃣ You say that this is simply knowing.🔽
1️⃣ It follows that all beings are a single thing.🔽
What has mind and what does not have mind🔽 Are thus identical, for both are equal in existing.🔽
1️⃣ If the different kinds of mind are all unreal,🔽 What common basis can there be for them?🔽
Something destitute of mind, we hold, is not a self.🔽
1️⃣ For mindlessness means matter, like a vase.🔽 
“ But,” you say, “the self has consciousness when joined to mind.”🔽
2️⃣ Then this refutes its nature of unconsciousness.🔽
If the self, moreover, is immutable,🔽 What change in it could mingling with the mind produce?🔽
1️⃣ And selfhood we might equally affirm🔽 Of empty space, inert and destitute of mind.🔽 
“If self does not exist,” you say,🔽 “There is no link connecting actions with results.🔽
1️⃣ If when the deed is done, the doer is no more,🔽 Who is there to reap the karmic fruit?”🔽
The bases of the act and fruit are not the same,🔽 In both a self is without scope for action.🔽
2️⃣ This is valid both for you and us;🔽 What point is there, therefore, in our debate?🔽 
“A cause coterminous with its result”🔽 Is something quite impossible to see.🔽
1️⃣ And only in the context of a single mental stream🔽 Can it be said that one who acts will later reap the fruit.🔽
The thoughts now passed, and those to come, are not the self;🔽 They are no more, or are not yet.🔽
1️⃣ Is then the self the thought which now is born?🔽
2️⃣ If so, it sinks to nothing when the latter fades.🔽
1️⃣ For instance, we may take banana trees—🔽 Cutting through the fibers, finding nothing.🔽
1️⃣ Likewise analytical investigation🔽 Will find no “I,” no underlying self.🔽 
“If beings,” you will say, “have no existence,🔽 Who will be the object of compassion?”🔽
1️⃣ Those whom ignorance imputes,🔽 For whose sake we have pledged ourselves.🔽 
“If,” you ask, “there are no beings, who will gain the fruit?”🔽
1️⃣ It’s true! It is through ignorance that they are said to be!🔽
1️⃣ But for the total vanquishing of sorrow,🔽 The goal, which ignorance conceives, should not be spurned.🔽
The source of sorrow is the pride of saying “I,”🔽 It’s fostered and increased by false belief in self.🔽
To this you may believe that there is no redress,🔽 But meditation on no-self will be the supreme way.🔽
What we call the body is not feet or shins;🔽 The body, likewise, is not thighs or loins.🔽
It’s not the belly nor indeed the back,🔽 And from the chest and arms the body is not formed.🔽
The body is not ribs or hands,🔽 Armpits, shoulders, bowels, or entrails.🔽
1️⃣ It is not the head, and it is not the throat.🔽
What is the “body,” then, in all of this?🔽
If the “body” spreads itself🔽 And with the members coincides,🔽 Its parts indeed are present in those parts.🔽
1️⃣ But where does “body,” in itself, abide?🔽
But if the “body,” single and entire🔽 Is present in the hands and other members,🔽 However many parts there are, the hands and all the rest,🔽 You’ll find an equal quantity of “bodies.”🔽
If “body” is not outside or within its parts,🔽 How is it, then, residing in its members?🔽
1️⃣ And since it is not other than its parts,🔽 How can you say that it exists at all?🔽
Thus there is no “body.”🔽
1️⃣ It is through illusion,🔽 With regard to hands and other parts, that “body” as a notion is conceived—🔽 Just as on account of its specific shape🔽 A pile of stones is taken for a man.🔽
As long as the conditions are assembled,🔽 The body will appear to be a man.🔽
1️⃣ As long as all the parts are likewise present,🔽 A body will appear therein.🔽
Likewise, since it is a group of fingers,🔽 The hand itself does not exist as such.🔽
2️⃣ And so it is with fingers, made of joints—🔽 And joints themselves consist of many parts.🔽
These parts themselves will break down into particles,🔽 And particles divide according to direction.🔽
2️⃣ These fragments, too, lack partless parts;🔽 
they are like space.🔽1️⃣ Thus even particles have no existence.🔽
All form, therefore, is like a dream,🔽 And who will be attached to it, who thus investigates?🔽
1️⃣ The body, in this way, has no existence;🔽 What, therefore, is male and what is female?🔽
If suffering itself is truly real,🔽 Why is joy not altogether quenched thereby?🔽
1️⃣ If pleasure’s real, then why will pleasant tastes🔽 Not comfort and amuse a man in agony?🔽
If the feeling fails to be experienced,🔽 Through being overwhelmed by something stronger,🔽 How can “feeling” rightly be ascribed🔽 To that which lacks the character of being felt?🔽
Perhaps you say that only subtle pain remains,🔽 Its grosser form has now been overmastered—🔽 Or rather it is felt as “mere pleasure.”🔽
1️⃣ But what is subtle still remains itself.🔽
If, because its opposite is present,🔽 Discomfort fails to manifest,🔽 Is not the claim that it’s a “feeling”🔽 No more than a mental imputation?🔽
Since so it is, the antidote🔽 Is meditation and analysis.🔽
1️⃣ Absorption grown in fields of their investigation🔽 Is indeed the food and sustenance of yogis.🔽
If between the sense power and a thing🔽 There is a space, how will the two terms meet?🔽
1️⃣ And if there is no space, they form a unity,🔽 And therefore what is it that meets with what?🔽
No penetration can there be of particle by particle,🔽 For they are both the same in lacking volume.🔽
1️⃣ But if they do not penetrate, they do not merge;🔽 And if they do not merge, there’s no encounter.🔽
1️⃣ For how could anyone accept🔽 That what is partless could be said to meet?🔽
And you must show me, if you ever saw,🔽 A contact taking place between two partless things.🔽
2️⃣ Consciousness is immaterial,🔽 And so one cannot speak of contact with it.🔽
1️⃣ A combination, too, has no reality,🔽 Just as we have previously shown.🔽
If therefore there’s no touch or contact,🔽 Whence is it that feeling takes its rise?🔽
What purpose is there, then, in all our toil,🔽 For what is it, indeed, that torments what?🔽
1️⃣ Since there is no subject for sensation,🔽 And sensation, too, lacks all existence,🔽 How is craving not arrested🔽 When all this is clearly understood?🔽
What we see and what we touch🔽 Is stuff of dreams and mirages.🔽1️⃣ If feeling is coincident with consciousness,🔽 
It follows that it is not seen thereby.🔽
If the one arises first, the other after,🔽 Memory occurs and not direct sensation.🔽
1️⃣ Sensation is without perception of itself🔽 And likewise, by another it is not perceived.🔽
The agent of sensation has no real existence,🔽 Thus sensation, likewise, has no being.🔽
1️⃣ What damage, therefore, can sensation do to it—🔽 This aggregate deprived of self?🔽
1️⃣ The mind within the senses does not dwell,🔽 It has no place in outer things like form.🔽
1️⃣ And in between, the mind does not abide:🔽 Not out, not in, not elsewhere, can the mind be found.🔽
It is not in the body, yet is nowhere else.🔽
1️⃣ It does not merge with it nor stand apart—🔽 Something such as this does not exist, not even slightly.🔽
1️⃣ Beings by their nature are beyond the reach of suffering.🔽
If consciousness precedes the cognized object,🔽 With regard to what does it arise?🔽
1️⃣ If consciousness arises at the same time as its object,🔽 Again, regarding what does it arise?🔽
If consciousness comes later than its object,🔽 Once again, from what does it arise?🔽
1️⃣ Thus the origin of all phenomena🔽 Exceeds the reach of understanding.🔽 
“If this is so,” you say, “there is no relative,🔽 And then the two truths—what becomes of them?🔽
1️⃣ Moreover, if the relative derives from beings’ minds,🔽 How can they pass beyond their sorrows?”🔽
But that is just the thought of others;🔽 It is not what I mean by the relative.🔽
1️⃣ If subsequently there are thoughts, the relative’s still there;🔽 If not, the relative has ceased indeed.🔽
The analyzing mind and what is analyzed🔽 Are linked together, mutually dependent.🔽
1️⃣ It is on the basis of conventional consensus🔽 That all investigation is expressed.🔽 
“But when,” you say, “the process of analysis🔽 Is made, in turn, the object of our scrutiny,🔽 This investigation likewise may be analyzed,🔽 And thus we find an infinite regress.”🔽
If phenomena are truly analyzed,🔽 No basis for analysis remains.🔽
2️⃣ And when the object is removed, the subject too subsides.🔽
That indeed is said to be nirvāṇa.🔽
Those who say that both are true,🔽 Are hard-pressed to maintain their case.🔽
1️⃣ If consciousness reveals the truth of things,🔽 On what grounds, in its turn, does consciousness exist?🔽
If knowledge objects show that consciousness exists,🔽 What is it that shows that they exist?🔽
1️⃣ If both subsist through mutual dependence,🔽 Both will thereby lose their true existence.🔽
If, without a son, a man cannot be father,🔽 Whence, indeed, will such a son arise?🔽
There is no father in the absence of a son.🔽
2️⃣ Just so, the mind and object have no true existence.🔽 
“ The plant arises from the seed,” you say,🔽 “And through it is the seed deduced.🔽
2️⃣ It’s just the same with consciousness arising from its object.🔽
1️⃣ How can it fail to show the thing’s existence?”🔽
A consciousness that’s different from the plant itself🔽 Deduces the existence of the seed.🔽
1️⃣ But what will show that consciousness exists,🔽 Whereby the object is itself established?🔽
In everyday perception🔽 There’s a cause for everything.🔽
The different segments of the lotus flower🔽 Arise from a variety of causes.🔽 
“But what gives rise,” you ask, “to such variety of causes?”🔽
1️⃣ An even earlier variety of causes, we declare.🔽 
“ And how,” you ask, “do causes give their fruits?”🔽
1️⃣ Through power, we answer, of preceding causes.🔽
2️⃣ If Īshvara is held to be the cause of beings,🔽 
You must now define for us his nature.🔽1️⃣ If, by this, you simply mean the elements,🔽 No need to tire ourselves disputing names!🔽
Yet earth and other elements are many,🔽 Impermanent, inert, without divinity.🔽
2️⃣ Trampled underfoot, they are impure,🔽 And thus they cannot be a God Omnipotent.🔽
2️⃣ The Deity cannot be space—inert and unproductive.🔽
1️⃣ He cannot be the self, for this we have refuted.🔽
2️⃣ He’s inconceivable, they say—then likewise his creatorship.🔽
1️⃣ Is there any point, therefore, to such a claim?🔽
What is it that he wishes to create?🔽
2️⃣ Has he made the self and all the elements?🔽
1️⃣ But are not self and elements and he himself eternal?🔽
1️⃣ And consciousness, we know, arises from its object.🔽
Pain and pleasure have, from all time, sprung from karma,🔽 So tell us, what has his Divinity produced?🔽
And if there’s no beginning in the cause,🔽 How can there be beginnings in its fruits?🔽
Why are creatures not created constantly,🔽 For Īshvara relies on nothing but himself?🔽
And if there’s nothing that he has not made,🔽 What remains on which he might depend?🔽
If Īshvara depends, the cause of all🔽 Is but the meeting of conditions and not Īshvara.🔽
1️⃣ When these obtain, he cannot but create;🔽 When these are absent, he is powerless to make.🔽
If Almighty God does not intend,🔽 But yet creates, another thing has forced him.🔽
1️⃣ If he wishes to create, he’s swayed by his desire.🔽
1️⃣ So even though Creator, what of his omnipotence?🔽
Those who hold the permanence of particles🔽 Were indeed refuted earlier.🔽
1️⃣ The Sāṃkhyas are the ones who hold🔽 That permanent prakṛiti is the cause of the evolving world.🔽 
“ Pleasure,” “pain,” “neutrality,” so-called,🔽 Are qualities which, when they rest🔽 In equilibrium are termed “prakṛiti.”🔽
3️⃣ The universe arises when this balance is disturbed.🔽
Three natures in a unity are disallowed,🔽 And thus prakṛiti is without existence.🔽
1️⃣ These qualities likewise do not exist,🔽 For each of them indeed is three.🔽
If these qualities have no existence,🔽 A thing like sound is very far from plausible!🔽
And cloth and other mindless objects🔽 Cannot be the seat of feelings such as pleasure.🔽 
“ But,” you say, “these things possess the nature of their cause.”🔽
1️⃣ But have we not investigated “things” already?🔽
For you the cause is “pleasure” and the like,🔽 And yet from pleasure, cloth has never sprung!🔽
Pleasure, rather, is produced from cloth.🔽
1️⃣ If this is nonexistent, pleasure likewise.🔽
1️⃣ As for permanence of pleasure and the rest—🔽 Well, there’s a thing that’s never been observed!🔽
If pleasure and the rest are manifestly present,🔽 How comes it that they’re not perceived?🔽
1️⃣ And if you claim they take on subtle form,🔽 How is it that they are both gross and subtle?🔽
If coarseness is abandoned, subtlety assumed,🔽 Subtlety and grossness both lack permanence.🔽
1️⃣ So why not grant that, in this way,🔽 All things possess the character of transience?🔽
If the coarser aspect is none other than the pleasure,🔽 It’s clear that pleasure is itself impermanent.🔽
1️⃣ If you claim that what does not exist in any sense🔽 (Because it has no being) cannot manifest,🔽 Although you have denied the birth of things🔽 That did not previously exist, it’s this that you’re now saying!🔽
But if results exist within their cause,🔽 Those who eat their food consume their excrement.🔽
And likewise with the money they would spend on clothing,🔽 Let them rather buy the cotton grains to wear!🔽 
“ But,” you say, “the world is ignorant and blind.🔽
2️⃣ For this is taught by ‘those who know the truth.’”🔽
1️⃣ This knowledge must be present in the worldly too!🔽
1️⃣ And if they have it, why do they not see?🔽
1️⃣ If now you say that what the worldly see has no validity,🔽 This means that what they clearly see is false.🔽 
“If,” you ask, “there’s no validity in valid knowledge,🔽 Is not all that it assesses false?🔽
1️⃣ And therefore it becomes untenable🔽 To meditate on voidness, ultimate reality.”🔽
If there is no object for analysis,🔽 There can be no grasping of its nonexistence.🔽
1️⃣ And so deceptive objects of whatever kind🔽 Will also have a nonexistence equally deceptive.🔽
When therefore in one’s dream a child has died,🔽 The state of mind that thinks it is no more🔽 Supplants the thought that it is living still.🔽
1️⃣ And yet both thoughts are equally deceptive.🔽
Therefore, as we see through such investigation,🔽 Nothing is that does not have a cause;🔽 And nothing is existent in its causes🔽 Taken one by one or in the aggregate.🔽
It does not come from somewhere else,🔽 Neither does it stay nor yet depart.🔽
1️⃣ How will what confusion takes for truth🔽 In any sense be different from a mirage?🔽
Things, then, bodied forth by magic spells,🔽 And that which is displayed by dint of causes—🔽 Whence have these arisen?🔽
1️⃣ we should ask; And where they go to, that we should examine!🔽
What is seen when circumstances meet🔽 And is not seen in absence of the same🔽 Is not real; it is like an image in a mirror.🔽
How can true existence be ascribed to it?🔽
What need is there for cause🔽 In something that’s already real?🔽
But then, what need is there for cause🔽 In something that does not exist?🔽
Even through a hundred million causes,🔽 No change takes place in nonexistent things,🔽 For in that state of “non-thing,” how could “things” occur?🔽
1️⃣ And into what could nonexistent things transform?🔽
Since things cannot become when they are nonexistent,🔽 When could such existent things occur?🔽
For insofar as entities do not arise,🔽 Nonentities themselves will not depart.🔽
And if nonentity is not dispersed,🔽 No chance is there for entity to manifest.🔽
And entity cannot be changed into nonentity,🔽 For otherwise it has a double nature.🔽
Thus there are no entities🔽 And likewise there’s no ceasing of the same.🔽
1️⃣ And therefore beings, each and every one,🔽 Are without origin and never cease.🔽
Wandering beings, thus, resemble dreams,🔽 And also the banana tree, if you examine well.🔽
1️⃣ In ultimate reality there’s no distinguishing🔽 Between the states of sorrow and beyond all sorrow.🔽
With things that in this way are empty🔽 What is there to gain and what to lose?🔽
1️⃣ Who is there to pay me court and honors,🔽 And who is there to scorn and to revile me?🔽
Pleasure, sorrow—whence do these arise?🔽
2️⃣ What is there to give me joy and pain?🔽
And if I search their very suchness,🔽 Who is craving? What is craved?🔽
Examine now this world of living beings:🔽 Who is there therein to pass away?🔽
2️⃣ What is there to come, and what has been?🔽
And who, indeed, are relatives and friends?🔽
May beings like myself discern and grasp🔽 That all things have the character of space!🔽
But those who seek their happiness and ease,🔽 Through disputes or enjoyments,🔽 All are deeply troubled, or else thrilled with joy.🔽
They suffer, strive, contend among themselves,🔽 Slashing, stabbing, injuring each other:🔽 They live their lives engulfed in evil and travail.🔽
From time to time they surface in the states of bliss,🔽 Abandoning themselves to many pleasures.🔽
But dying, down they fall to suffer torment,🔽 Long, unbearable, in realms of sorrow.🔽
🔽2️⃣ Many are the chasms and abysses of existence,🔽 Where the truth of suchness is not found.🔽
1️⃣ All is contradiction, all denial;🔽 Suchness in this world is not like this.🔽
1️⃣ Here, exceeding all description,🔽 Is the shoreless sea of pain unbearable.🔽
Here it is that strength is low,🔽 And lives are flickering and brief.🔽
1️⃣ All activities for sake of life and health,🔽 Relief of hunger and of weariness,🔽 Time consumed in sleep, all accident and injury,🔽 And sterile friendships with the childish—🔽 Thus life passes quickly, meaningless.🔽
1️⃣ True discernment—hard it is to have!🔽
1️⃣ How therefore shall we ever find the means🔽 To curb the futile wanderings of the mind?🔽
Further, evil forces work and strain🔽 To cast us down into the states of woe;🔽 Manifold are false, deceptive trails,🔽 And it is hard to dissipate our doubts.🔽
Hard it is to find again this state of freedom,🔽 
Harder yet to come upon enlightened teachers,🔽 
Hard, indeed, to turn aside the torrent of defilement!🔽
2️⃣ Alas, our sorrows fall in endless streams!🔽1️⃣ Alas indeed that living beings,🔽 Carried on the flood of bitter pain,🔽 However terrible their plight may be,🔽 Do not perceive they suffer so!🔽
They are like those who bathe themselves repeatedly🔽 And then proceed to scorch themselves with fire.🔽
1️⃣ They suffer greatly in this way,🔽 Yet there they stay, proclaiming loud their bliss.🔽
Likewise there are some who live and act🔽 As though old age and death will never come to them.🔽
But first they’re slain and then there comes🔽 The dreadful fall into the states of loss.🔽
When shall I be able to allay and quench🔽 The dreadful heat of suffering’s blazing fires🔽 With plenteous rains of my own bliss🔽 That pour torrential from my clouds of merit?🔽
1️⃣ My wealth of merit gathered in,🔽 With reverence but without conceptual target,🔽 When shall I reveal this truth of emptiness🔽 To those who go to ruin through belief in real existence?🔽
🔽
1️⃣ 10 Dedication🔽 
By all the virtue I have now amassed🔽 By composition of this book, which speaks🔽 Of entry to the Bodhisattva way,🔽 May every being tread the path to Buddhahood.🔽
May beings everywhere who suffer🔽 Torment in their minds and bodies🔽 Have, by virtue of my merit,🔽 Joy and happiness in boundless measure.🔽
As long as they may linger in saṃsāra,🔽 May their joy be undiminished;🔽 May they taste of unsurpassed beatitude🔽 In constant and unbroken continuity.🔽
Throughout the spheres and reaches of the world,🔽 In hellish states as many as there are,🔽 May beings who abide there taste🔽 The bliss and peace of Sukhāvatī.🔽
May those caught in the freezing ice be warmed,🔽 And from great clouds of Bodhisattvas🔽 Torrents rain in boundless streams🔽 To cool those burning in infernal fires.🔽
May forests where the leaves are blades and swords🔽 Become sweet groves and pleasant woodland glades.🔽
2️⃣ And may the trees of miracles appear,🔽 Supplanting those upon the hill of Shālmali.🔽
And may the very pits of hell be sweet🔽 With fragrant pools all perfumed with the scent of lotuses,🔽 And lovely with the cries of swan and goose🔽 And waterfowl so pleasing to the ear.🔽
May fiery coals turn into heaps of jewels,🔽 The burning ground become an even crystal floor,🔽 May crushing hills become sublime abodes:🔽 May the hail of weapons, lava, fiery stones🔽 Become henceforth a rain of flowers.🔽
1️⃣ And all the mutual woundings with sharp blades🔽 Be now a rain of flowers thrown in play.🔽
And those engulfed in fiery Vaitaraṇī,🔽 Their flesh destroyed, their bones bleached white as kunda flowers,🔽 May they, through all my merits’ strength, have godlike forms🔽 And sport with goddesses in Mandākinī’s peaceful streams.🔽 
“What fear is it,” they’ll ask, “that grips the henchmen of the Deadly Lord, the frightful vultures, and the carrion crows?🔽
1️⃣ What noble strength is it that brings us joy and drives away our dreadful night?”🔽
1️⃣ And looking skyward they will see the shining form of Vajrapāṇi.🔽
1️⃣ Then may their sins be quenched in joy and may they go to him.🔽
And when they see the seething lava-flood of hell🔽 Extinguished in a rain of blossoms, drenched in fragrant streams,🔽 At once fulfilled in bliss, they’ll ask, “How can this be?”🔽
1️⃣ May then the denizens of hell behold the One Who Holds the Lotus.🔽 
“Friends, throw away your fears and quickly gather here.🔽
1️⃣ For who is it who comes to us to banish dread, this gleaming youth with bound-up hair,🔽 This loving Bodhisattva saving and protecting every being,🔽 Whose power relieves all pain, bestowing joy?🔽 
“Behold the hundred gods who lay their crowns before his lotus feet,🔽 The rain of flowers that falls upon his head, his eyes moist with compassion,🔽 The splendor of his house that echoes praises of a thousand goddesses!”🔽
1️⃣ May those in hell thus cry on seeing Mañjughoṣha.🔽
And likewise, through my roots of virtue,🔽 Seeing Bodhisattvas like Samantabhadra, free from stain,🔽 Those clouds of bliss all laden with a cooling scented rain,🔽 May all those languishing in hell come now to perfect joy.🔽
And may the stooping animals be freed🔽 From fear of being preyed upon, each other’s food.🔽
