The 'fire' refers to the appearance of seven suns, which gradually burns everything without remainder from the desire realm up to the first meditation level. 'Benefits' means qualities. 'Immeasurable' means beyond calculation. 'Sudhana' refers to the merchant's son. 'Wise' means possessing great wisdom. It was taught that 'Noble son, bodhicitta is the seed of all Buddha qualities.'

The aspirational mind is the wish 'May I achieve Buddhahood.' The mind of engagement is the mind that, having generated the aspiration for supreme enlightenment, is actively practicing.\"\n\nC.

Thus, there are the mind of aspiration for enlightenment and the mind of engagement in enlightenment.\"\n\nD. Combined Summary:\nThe commentaries explain that bodhicitta, while having many subtle classifications, can be fundamentally divided into two types: aspirational and engaging. Aspirational bodhicitta is the initial wish to achieve Buddhahood, while engaging bodhicitta represents the active implementation of that aspiration through practice.

For example, just as there is a difference between one who has the intention to go to a village and another who has actually entered the path and is going, these two are distinct. The 'wise one' refers to one who has developed exceptional wisdom. 'Respectively' means not deviating from the sequence, following the proper order of enumeration.\"\n\nC.

The wise ones who wish to accomplish both their own and others' benefit should understand the distinction between these two examples in their respective order.\"\n\nD.

'Wishing to abandon' means having the intention to be liberated from it. For that very reason, 'though desiring happiness' means although explicitly wanting happiness.

Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries explain that beings are caught in a paradox: they want to be free from suffering (cyclic existence) but engage in actions that cause more suffering. They desire happiness but, due to ignorance about karma and the proper methods for achieving happiness, they destroy the very causes of their own happiness by abandoning virtue and engaging in negative actions.\n\nE.

The first commentary also suggests that this quality extends to other unmentioned aspects of his nature.\n\nE.

Commentary 1 Translation:\n\"Now, to show that one should strive diligently after generating bodhicitta, the text states 'Child of the Victorious Ones thus...' and so forth. 'Thus' refers to having previously performed the ritual procedures such as making offerings. 'Firmly' means not abandoning it even at the cost of one's life. 'Without laziness' means without distraction. 'Training' refers to what needs to be done. This shows how those who have taken the vows should think.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"The third, regarding how to engage in practice: Although there are generally six perfections, here giving is not mentioned separately. Of the remaining five, starting with moral discipline, there are two aspects: mindfulness and awareness. Regarding the nature of mindfulness: it is taking care in what to adopt and abandon. As stated in the Compendium: 'What is mindfulness? It is cultivating virtuous qualities and protecting the mind regarding contaminated phenomena while abiding in non-attachment, non-hatred, non-ignorance, and diligence.' These are the methods for all virtuous actions, as stated in the King of Samadhi Sutra: 'Of all virtuous qualities that are described, mindfulness is the root of them all.'\"\n\nD. Combined Summary:\nThe commentaries emphasize that after generating bodhicitta through proper ritual procedures, one should maintain it firmly without abandoning it even at the cost of life. The practice requires unwavering mindfulness and awareness, particularly in maintaining moral discipline and other trainings. This mindfulness serves as the foundation for all virtuous qualities and should be practiced with constant diligence and without distraction.\n\nE.

Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries explain that this verse deals with actions undertaken without proper consideration.

After clearing this incidental debate, we should connect it to the main context.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"Addressing objections: When Shariputra practiced bodhisattva conduct, he cut off his right hand when a demon asked for it, and gave it with his left. When the demon expressed displeasure, he became discouraged and abandoned bodhicitta, yet still attained arhatship. Similarly, in the Suvarṇavarṇa Sutra, someone who practiced bodhisattva conduct for forty eons abandoned bodhicitta and immediately became a pratyekabuddha. How to resolve these contradictions? The way these beings achieve liberation despite abandoning bodhicitta is inconceivable to ordinary beings; only the Omniscient One knows this. Gelha states they are liberated because they skillfully take it up again after abandoning it. Vibhūti says they abandon conventional bodhicitta but retain ultimate bodhicitta. This makes sense - though they abandon the mind of benefiting others, they retain the wisdom realizing selflessness and thus avoid lower realms. However, why tire ourselves contemplating the inconceivable?\"\n\nD.

They both stress the metaphor of the body being like a borrowed object, highlighting its temporary nature and our lack of ultimate control over it. The commentaries reinforce the Buddhist concept of impermanence (anitya) and the illusory nature of apparent stability.\n\nE.

They explain that since unruly beings are as limitless as space, attempting to defeat them all is futile. Instead, by destroying one's own anger through mindfulness and awareness, it's equivalent to defeating all enemies. The true practice of patience lies in managing one's own mental state rather than trying to change others.\n\nE.

Without knowing this, even though one desires to attain happiness and eliminate suffering, they wander meaninglessly in samsara. As stated in the sutra: 'Knowing beings are confused like deer caught in a trap, the wise move freely like birds in the sky.'

Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries emphasize that the secret nature of mind (emptiness) is the essence of all dharma.

This is like a water channel protecting the flow of virtue. When accomplishing this, other special aspects should be set aside or abandoned.

And because of being engaged with objects, it cannot be stopped.\"\n\nB. Commentary 1 Translation:\n\"Since there is no producing cause for both of these, there is no arising. That which is devoid of causes, like the son of a barren woman, does not exist, so how can it be considered self-arising? Moreover, if the self exists, since it was not previously of the nature of experiencing, it should not be connected with the nature of experiencing. Alternatively, even if the principal (pradhāna) presents objects and allows for the activity of experiencing, it cannot cease, because the self that has turned away from that object is not accepted to exist, as that self is permanent. The same fault applies to the self accepted by the Naiyāyikas because it is permanent. This fault is specifically explained regarding that.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"If that itself does not exist when unborn, then how can it be desired to arise as something that causes harm, etc.? This is universally true. The second part has two aspects: refuting the experiencer and refuting the producer of effects. For the first: If it's claimed that the self experiences objects presented by the principal, then the self, as the subject, would never cease or become non-existent in relation to grasping a single object like an enemy, because it constantly engages with that single object like an enemy. This is accepted in the premises. The word 'also' indicates that it cannot engage either, because it is permanent. The second aspect explains that according to the Great Commentary, this refutes the Naiyāyika's concept of a permanent, non-conscious self.\"\n\nD. Combined Summary:\nThe commentaries explain that the verse refutes both the arising and functioning of a permanent self. They emphasize that:\n1. Without causes, nothing can arise\n2. A permanent self cannot begin experiencing if it didn't do so before\n3. If the self constantly engages with objects, it cannot cease or change its engagement\n4.

When there is pain, at whom should one be angry?\"\n\nB. Commentary 1 Translation:\n\"To clarify what was previously taught, the term 'boil' is mentioned. It is intolerable to touch, meaning it is either very hot or difficult to endure. Being overwhelmed by the darkness of craving, preventing clear understanding, is 'blind with craving.' 'Being grasped' means having accepted or taken hold of it. 'To that' refers to the body. 'To whom' means to whom should one direct anger.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"Therefore, when this human form, which is like a boil, intolerable to touch and full of suffering, is grasped by oneself who is blinded by craving for the body and other things - meaning the eye of wisdom is blocked - and when all harm arises from this grasping, at whom should one be angry? It is not reasonable to be angry at others.\"\n\nD. Combined Summary:\nThe commentaries explain that the verse uses the metaphor of a boil to describe the human body. This body, which is painful and difficult to touch, is grasped due to our craving and ignorance. When we experience suffering as a result of this grasping, it's unreasonable to blame others since we ourselves, blinded by craving, chose to grasp onto this painful form.\n\nE.

Sanskrit Translation:\n\"If while living on gains, I perform merit and eliminate sin,\nThen surely, when angry for the sake of gains, won't merit be destroyed and sin increase?\"\n\nB. Commentary 1 Translation:\n\"The phrase 'If by gains' is stated to raise the argument that 'if one has gains, one should perform merit and eliminate sin.' The response is given by the phrase 'for the sake of gains,' meaning: if you become angry for the sake of gains, why wouldn't it become the exact opposite? What's the use of merit then? For now, one thinks that through gains, one will live happily for a long time.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"The third point: If one lives long due to having complete favorable conditions through gains, as it is said: 'As long as one lives practicing Dharma, for that long the continuum of virtue increases greatly.'

Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries discuss the paradox of seeking gains for spiritual purposes. While gains might enable one to practice Dharma longer and accumulate merit, becoming angry to protect these gains defeats the purpose, as anger itself destroys merit and creates negative karma.

Therefore, having obtained a human body, why should one's diligence toward achieving enlightenment deteriorate even for the sake of one's life? As stated in the Dream Teaching: 'Even those with the smallest qualities can attain enlightenment through superior intention.'\n\nThe reason for this is that all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature. In general, there are two types of nature: the naturally abiding nature, which is the nature of mind itself, and the developmental nature, which emerges from purifying various obscurations or from virtuous imprints placed in the mind. The first type pervades all sentient beings, as stated in the Uttaratantra: 'Because the perfect Buddha's form radiates, because suchness is indivisible, and because they possess the potential, all beings always possess Buddha-nature.'\"\n\nD. Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentary emphasizes that even the smallest creatures have the potential for enlightenment due to the universal presence of Buddha-nature. It uses scriptural references to support this point and explains the two types of Buddha-nature: inherent and developed. The main message is that if even tiny insects can achieve enlightenment through effort, humans should be especially diligent in their practice.\n\nE. English Translation of Tibetan Text:\n<t>Even those who were flies, mosquitoes, bees, and likewise insects - if they generate the power of diligence, they too will attain the supreme enlightenment that is difficult to achieve.</t>",

Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"If abandoned, as a result similar to its cause, in other births too, one becomes habituated to breaking commitments, leading to the karmic result of increasing sin and the ripening result of suffering. Having abandoned that, both the other undertaking and its resultant timely virtues become diminished, not reaching completion. This is because even that itself will not be accomplished.\"\n\nD. Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries explain that abandoning virtuous activities after beginning them has three main consequences:\n1. It creates a negative habit pattern that carries into future lives\n2. It leads to increased sin and suffering\n3. It diminishes both current and future virtuous activities and their results\nBoth commentaries emphasize that abandoning virtuous commitments not only affects the present but has long-term karmic implications.\n\nE. English Translation of Tibetan Text:\n<t>In other births, becoming habituated to this [abandonment],\nSin and suffering will increase.\nOther [virtuous activities] and their time of fruition\nWill diminish, and that [goal] will not be accomplished.</t>",

Therefore, abandoning worldly activities for physical solitude and completely discarding conceptual thoughts about desires and so forth for mental solitude.\"\n\nD. Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nBoth commentaries emphasize the importance of two types of solitude:\n1. Physical solitude: removing oneself from worldly activities\n2.

The first has two parts: abandoning busy activities by seeing their faults and instructions on relying on solitude through seeing its qualities. The first has two parts: developing the mind of renunciation and adopting methods of abandonment.

Therefore, the wise who wish to abandon afflictions should completely give up these attachments and cravings and practice as follows.

Commentary 1 Translation:\n\"To explain the analysis itself, the term 'shamatha' is mentioned. Shamatha is concentration (samadhi). Vipashyana is wisdom (prajna). Non-attachment means being free from clinging. The meaning is to generate joy that is free from attachment and clinging.\"\n\nC.

The explanation is this: A woman's body produces impurities such as excrement and so forth, which are represented by the word 'excrement.'\"\n\nC.

Of these two, while you find excrement repulsive, why are you attracted to women's saliva?\"\n\nD. Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries explain that this verse is addressing those who are deluded by attraction, specifically focusing on the inconsistency in their attitude toward different bodily substances. Both commentaries emphasize that all bodily substances (saliva and excrement) come from the same source (food), yet people irrationally discriminate between them, being attracted to one while finding the other repulsive.

Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries explain that the verse addresses the misconception of being attracted to the body because of its pleasant smell.

Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries explain that this verse challenges the logic of self-interest. If we refuse to help others because their suffering doesn't affect us, then by the same logic, we shouldn't protect ourselves from future suffering since it doesn't affect our present self. This reveals the inconsistency in the distinction between self and other, and between present and future selves.\n\nE.

Alternatively, harm to the king means suffering in the next world. Not avoiding means he made a commitment without considering his own welfare. Many people's suffering was eliminated means the momentary mental afflictions of many suffering people were eliminated or stopped. Or, the decline of self-interest of those to be trained who were suffering was eliminated, meaning their suffering was eliminated through his own suffering. At King Dpal byin's throne called Rinchen Ldan, the king had wrong views and banished the monk Bodhisattva Supushpachandra and others to the forest. Supushpachandra, unable to bear it due to great compassion, went to a solitary place and thought that by disregarding his life, he could benefit not just the single king but many beings. Despite others' attempts to stop him, he went to the royal throne and taught Dharma to many beings.

Although knowing the king would kill him, he went there. For seven days without food, he circumambulated the Tathagata's nail stupa at night and taught Dharma in the palace during the day, establishing many millions of beings in enlightenment before being killed by the king.

This one does (good), the other doesn't - generate envy towards yourself.\"\n\nB. Commentary 1 Translation:\n\"In order to teach the meditation on envy, the verse starting with 'I am happy' is stated. The envy towards oneself refers to the previous self. The fault is the wrongdoing.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"The second part has three aspects: generating envy through intention, applying suffering through action, and establishing both as inferior.

Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries explain that this verse is about cultivating a particular kind of self-reflection through the lens of envy. It suggests examining one's privileged position compared to others' suffering, and using this awareness to generate a kind of constructive self-criticism. The practice involves three aspects: mental cultivation of envy, practical application regarding suffering, and recognition of the inferior nature of both self-elevation and others' denigration.\n\nE.

Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries explain that desiring what's beyond one's capability leads to mental afflictions, exhaustion, and disappointment. They emphasize the contrast between those who cling to desires (leading to suffering) and those who remain free from attachments (leading to lasting happiness).

The five aggregates of clinging are the characteristics of suffering to be reversed. Those wishing for pacification should actively cultivate this.

Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"The third has three parts: the classification of persons, the sequence of invalidation, and the reasoning of invalidation. First, regarding these two truths, worldly beings or persons are seen as twofold: those who possess meditative concentration of calm abiding and special insight are yogis, and those who don't are ordinary people. Although commentaries explain it this way, it's more appropriate to distinguish between those who possess and don't possess the three types of wisdom regarding selflessness. Second, among these two worlds, ordinary people view the body as unitary and mind as permanent. The yogic world invalidates this through reasoning: the body is not unitary because it possesses many parts, and the mind is impermanent because it undergoes change.\"\n\nD. Combined Summary:\nThe commentaries explain that there are two types of people: yogis who understand reality through meditation and wisdom, and ordinary people who are bound by ignorance. Yogis understand both conventional and ultimate truth through reasoning and scripture, while ordinary people hold incorrect views about reality, such as believing in a unitary body and permanent mind. The yogic understanding invalidates these ordinary misconceptions through logical reasoning.\n\nE. English Translation of Tibetan Text:\n<t>In this regard, two worlds are seen:\nThat of the yogis and that of ordinary beings.\nAmong these, the ordinary world\nIs invalidated by the yogic world.</t>",

Commentary 1 Translation:\nThe commentary explains that yogis are not only able to refute ordinary people but also other yogis. Those with superior understanding can refute those with lesser understanding. Both ordinary people and yogis accept examples like illusions and mirages to demonstrate the non-existence of phenomena. The commentary emphasizes that if yogis who assert non-existence can refute other yogis, then their ability to refute ordinary perception goes without saying. Regarding the practice of generosity and other perfections, these should be practiced without analysis of their ultimate nature, as they serve as methods for realizing ultimate truth.\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\nThis commentary discusses three types of yogis: Realists, Mind-Only practitioners, and Madhyamikas. Each superior level refutes the lower through their more refined understanding. The Realists' atomic theory is refuted by Mind-Only arguments, and the Mind-Only view is in turn refuted by Madhyamika reasoning. It explains how examples accepted by both sides can demonstrate the illusory nature of phenomena, and how conventional truth serves as a method for realizing ultimate truth.\n\nD.

Unlike yogis who see things as illusion-like, worldly beings do not see things this way, hence there is dispute here.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"The second part addresses two types of disputes: conventional and ultimate. The first has five parts: non-engagement with the path, non-dispute about objects, refutation by valid cognition, contradiction with scripture, and rejection of extreme consequences. First, if all phenomena lack true existence, there would be no attainment of enlightenment through giving etc., so one wouldn't engage in these practices. Although ultimately these don't exist, conventionally they do exist unexamined, so engaging in giving etc. for enlightenment is not contradictory. Second, although both yogis and ordinary people perceive phenomena, ordinary people see forms etc. as real entities and conceive them as truly existent, not as illusion-like, while yogis understand them as illusion-like, hence the dispute between yogis and ordinary people.\"\n\nD. Combined Summary:\nThe key point of both commentaries is the fundamental difference in perception between ordinary beings and yogis. While both perceive phenomena, ordinary beings see them as inherently real and truly existent, arising from causes and conditions. In contrast, yogis understand these same appearances as illusion-like. This difference in understanding creates the basis for dispute between these two groups.\n\nE.

Commentary 1 Translation:\n\"If one thinks that forms and so forth are established through direct perception as capable of performing functions, how can this be refuted? The text states 'forms and so forth,' meaning that even though forms and so forth are established through direct perception, this is merely conventional recognition or worldly discourse.

Regarding an example of something directly perceived yet false, it mentions 'that which is impure,' explaining that just as a pure conception arises due to attachment to an impure woman's body, this is false because it grasps as pure what is not pure. Similarly with forms and so forth, even if not established by valid cognition.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"Third, if one objects that it's contradictory for forms and so forth to be false when established by direct perception, there is no contradiction.

As for how killing occurs with respect to others, it is explained that consciousness itself is illusory. 'Endowed with' means possessing that consciousness.

Regarding the crystal analogy: while a crystal becomes blue depending on external conditions like blue cloth, once its blue nature is established, it doesn't depend on others to maintain its blueness.

Indeed, how can something blue make itself blue by itself?\"\n\nB. Commentary 1 Translation:\n\"Similarly, while we see that some things like pots depend on others like lamps to be illuminated, we don't see lamps requiring other lights to be illuminated - they are self-illuminating. Likewise, when thinking consciousness is established as self-illuminating, the response is given starting with 'not blue.' This analogy is not appropriate. Whatever becomes blue is not independent of others, as it depends on its causes. If it were independent, then having originated as non-blue from its continuum, it would later make itself blue without depending on conditions. Since this is impossible, how can one say that becoming blue is independent? Alternatively, these verses about 'blue' etc. are reasoning for why a lamp is not self-illuminating, summarizing that even without dependence, something cannot illuminate itself.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"Some argue that just as naturally blue things like lapis lazuli don't depend on others to become blue, similarly some things like pots depend on illuminators while others like lamps and feelings are independent. This is incorrect. Some Tibetan scholars explain that since lapis lazuli is blue from the moment it originates, it cannot serve as an example of self-illumination or self-cognition because it never transforms from non-blue to blue by itself. Sherab Jung explains that even blueness depends on others to become blue as it depends on causes.

But when there is debate about self-awareness itself, how can memory be claimed as its result? Furthermore, since memory itself is knowledge, how can it be established? If one asks how memory occurs, it's explained that memory arises from the connection with experiencing objects other than consciousness. The meaning is that the special memory of experiencing objects is what is remembered. When asked what this is like, it's compared to rat poison: just as when rat poison applied with Dong-ro touches the body, later when thunder sounds, even without self-awareness, just that condition awakens the poison and makes it increase.\"\n\nC.

Commentary 1 Translation:\n\"'Other conditions' refers to meditation. 'Connected with that' refers to mind. It illuminates, meaning it makes other cognitions appear distinctly. Therefore, self-illumination must exist because it perceives other cognitions as they are. Similarly, it perceives its own mind as well, thus establishing self-awareness. In response to this, the example of medicine is given: When the ritual of preparing eye-ointment is accomplished, the excellent pot that is seen through the application isn't the eye-ointment itself. Therefore, one shouldn't conclude that because other minds are seen due to conditions, one's own mind is also seen.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"Regarding the second point: If one argues that because [mind] connected with other conditions like concentration can see distant cognitions of others, it should logically be able to clearly know its own nearby cognitions, this is inconclusive.

And through practicing 'nothing whatsoever exists,' even that [emptiness] is later eliminated.\"\n\nB. Commentary 1 Translation:\n\"If one wonders how the imprints of existence are eliminated, it is explained that through habituation to the imprints of emptiness—that is, through perfecting the yoga of meditation—one performs the action of elimination. Although there might seem to be no difference between the imprints of existence and the imprints of emptiness, as it is said: 'The Victor taught that all views are definitely liberated through emptiness. Whoever views emptiness is taught to be beyond accomplishment.' In response to this, it is said that through practicing 'nothing whatsoever,' even the nature of non-existence does not exist, and thus even the imprints of emptiness will cease to exist.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"Although one realizes illusions as empty, if one hasn't realized all phenomena as empty, the habitual tendencies of attachment will be activated. Through habituation to the imprints of knowing all phenomena as empty, the habitual tendencies of grasping phenomena as truly existent will be eliminated. Through realizing and becoming habituated to 'nothing whatsoever is established as either empty or non-empty,' even that grasping at emptiness or falsity will later be eliminated. Since it's impossible for afflictions to arise when there is no grasping at anything, these two are not equivalent.\"\n\nD. Combined Summary:\nThe commentaries explain a progressive elimination of mental imprints: first, the realization of emptiness helps eliminate the habitual tendencies of grasping at true existence. Then, through understanding that neither existence nor emptiness is established, even the subtle grasping at emptiness itself is eliminated. This is a graduated path where each realization builds upon the previous one, ultimately leading to freedom from all conceptual elaborations.\n\nE.

As stated in the Madhyamakavatara: 'Having burned all the dry fuel of knowable objects, that peace is the Dharmakaya of the Victorious Ones. At that time, there is neither arising nor cessation; through the cessation of mind, that kāya is actualized.' While this could be explained as meaning Buddhas have no wisdom, the Great Commentary states: 'It is peace because all conceptual thoughts have ceased, but it is not non-existence.' Therefore, it explains that conceptual mind grasping at the four alternatives ceases, but this doesn't mean wisdom is absent.\"\n\nD.

Commentary 1 Translation:\n\"The term 'wish-fulfilling' refers to the wish-fulfilling jewel, which is a special precious stone that grants results according to one's thoughts. The wish-granting tree is a special tree that gives fruits according to one's wishes. Similarly, the Victor (Buddha) is one who has completely conquered the four maras. The appearance of their form is seen through the thirty-two major marks of a great being. How is it seen? Since it's impossible for there to be no beings to be trained, it appears through the conditions of those to be trained who have obtained roots of virtue and made aspirations, and through the cause of the bodhisattva's previous prayers made for their sake. As it is said: 'Having entered that meditation, dwelling like a wish-fulfilling jewel, through the completion of accumulations and so forth, teachings arise according to wishes.' Also from the Fourth Praise: 'O Blessed Lord, without uttering even a single syllable, you satisfy all beings to be trained with a rain of Dharma.'\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"There are three points: accomplishing benefit without motivation, performing actions though the agent has ceased, and merit arising though there is no mind. Regarding the first: If one objects that the Buddha would not benefit others since there is no thought 'I should do this,' [the response is:] Just as wish-fulfilling jewels and wish-granting trees fulfill desires without conceptual motivation, through the power of their capabilities and the gathering of beings' merit, similarly, through the power of both the pure mindstreams of those to be trained and the bodhisattva's previous prayers to benefit them, the Victor's form appears and benefits arise without fault. This way of benefiting others without conceptual thought is extensively explained in the Wisdom Light Ornament Sutra.\"\n\nD. Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries explain how the Buddha's form manifests and benefits beings without conscious effort, similar to how wish-fulfilling jewels and wish-granting trees naturally fulfill wishes. This occurs through two conditions: the pure karma/aspirations of disciples and the Buddha's previous bodhisattva prayers. This explains how enlightened activity continues spontaneously without conceptual thought.\n\nE.

The response has three parts: brief scriptural citation, detailed explanation through debate, and general summary. First, regarding why emptiness must be seen, the Prajñāpāramitā scripture states that without this path of wisdom realizing emptiness, there is no enlightenment.

They explain that while seeing the Four Noble Truths leads to liberation, the complete path to enlightenment necessarily includes the realization of emptiness.

Not only the non-Buddhists, but also due to the divisions among one's own schools and other schools, because your accepted scriptures are disputed by both one's own and other schools' interpretations, they would have to be abandoned and cannot be accepted.

If it is different, then at that time it too would have six parts, thus: the four directions plus up and down make six.\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"When that part is divided into subtle particles, since that particle too becomes many through directional divisions, it cannot be truly singular. When each of its directions is divided, since it lacks truly existing parts, it is empty like space, therefore even the subtle particle itself does not truly exist.\"\n\nD. Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries explain that any supposedly indivisible particle can be analyzed in terms of its directional parts (six directions). This creates a logical problem: either these directional parts are different (in which case the particle is divisible) or they are the same (which contradicts their directional nature). Either way, this analysis shows that particles cannot be ultimately real or indivisible, just as space has no truly existing parts.\n\nE. English Translation of Tibetan Text:\n<t>When parts are divided into particles,\nAnd those particles are divided by directional parts,\nSince directional divisions are free from parts,\nLike space, therefore particles do not exist.</t>",

Similarly, if suffering existed truly, it would never be abandoned, so why wouldn't it harm joy and happiness which are contrary to it? Since joy and happiness do arise, this refutes that position.

When sense objects, sense organs, and consciousness come together and meet, there is contact, and from that contact, sensation arises. However, this meeting must either have an interval or no interval between them. If there is an interval, meaning they are separated, how can they come together?

Thus, the wise establish mindfulness regarding sensations.'\"\n\nC. Commentary 2 Translation:\n\"There is no experiencer whatsoever, therefore sensation itself does not exist ultimately. Thus, in this aggregate that is without self, how can pleasant sensations benefit or suffering sensations harm, since there is no establishment of that which benefits or harms?\"\n\nD. Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries emphasize that there is no independent experiencer of sensations, and therefore sensations themselves cannot be ultimately real. They explain that without a truly existent self, the conventional understanding of experiencing pleasure and pain becomes questionable. The first commentary specifically connects this to mindfulness practice, while the second commentary focuses on the logical impossibility of benefit or harm in the absence of a real experiencer.\n\nE.

Alternatively, while ultimate nature exists and conventional reality exists, it is established by the mind of another continuum. Thus, it's not just ultimate truth; since conventional reality is established, both are established, so two truths are expressed.

Combined Summary of Commentaries:\nThe commentaries explain that this verse addresses the epistemological problem of establishing valid knowledge. They point out that if we need one cognition to know an object, we would need another cognition to validate the first cognition, leading to infinite regress. This particularly challenges those who assert inherent existence while denying self-awareness of consciousness. The commentaries emphasize that while cause and effect work conventionally, they cannot be established as ultimately real.\n\nE.

Furthermore, if the Sāṃkhyas assert that clothes and other things possess the nature of pleasure etc. due to being composed of the three guṇas, this is not logical. This is because unconscious things like clothes are established as being unconscious, while pleasure etc. are established as being conscious. If one argues that because pleasure etc. are the nature of the cause of transformed entities, it is logical for clothes etc. to have the nature of pleasure etc., the response is that upon analysis, they are unconscious.
